figure out how to phase genotypes/haplotypes in ouput

maybe the --family optinon is not working as expected with summary stats
ensure that HWE filtering is occuring at the population level, rather than overall
 both the --hwe and --hardy options seem to work on all indidviduals
HWE should be examined in a haplotype constext.
How we evaluate the HWE results across populations

figure out a way to recode the "un" chromosomes into numbered chromosomes
for mapped snps replace with actual number!

incorporate life-history phenotypes in PLINK files

look at the --cm-map parameter in PLINK for map-aware analyses
