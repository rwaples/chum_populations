  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy is a major evolutionary process in eukaryotes-particularly in plants and, to a less extent, in animals, wherein several past and recent whole-genome duplication events have been described. Surprisingly, the incidence of polyploidy in other eukaryote kingdoms, particularly within fungi, remained largely disregarded by the scientific community working on the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy. Recent studies have significantly increased our knowledge of the occurrence and evolutionary significance of fungal polyploidy. The ecological, structural and functional consequences of polyploidy in fungi are reviewed here and compared with the knowledge acquired with conventional plant and animal models. In particular, the genus Saccharomyces emerges as a relevant model for polyploid studies, in addition to plant and animal models.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout have an XX/XY genetic mechanism of sex determination where males are the heterogametic sex. The homology of the sex-determining gene (SDG) in medaka to Dmrt1 suggested that SDGs evolve from downstream genes by gene duplication. Orthologous sequences of the major genes of the mammalian sex determination pathway have been reported in the rainbow trout but the map position for the majority of these genes has not been assigned. RESULTS: Five loci of four candidate genes (Amh, Dax1, Dmrt1 and Sox6) were tested for linkage to the Y chromosome of rainbow trout. We exclude the role of all these loci as candidates for the primary SDG in this species. Sox6i and Sox6ii, duplicated copies of Sox6, mapped to homeologous linkage groups 10 and 18 respectively. Genotyping fishes of the OSU x Arlee mapping family for Sox6i and Sox6ii alleles indicated that Sox6i locus might be deleted in the Arlee lineage. CONCLUSION: Additional candidate genes should be tested for their linkage to the Y chromosome. Mapping data of duplicated Sox6 loci supports previously suggested homeology between linkage groups 10 and 18. Enrichment of the rainbow trout genomic map with known gene markers allows map comparisons with other salmonids. Mapping of candidate sex-determining loci is important for analyses of potential autosomal modifiers of sex-determination in rainbow trout.},

  Abstract                 = {Considerable evidence suggests that one genome duplication event preceded the divergence of teleost fishes and a second genome duplication event occurred before the radiation of teleosts of the family Salmonidae. Two Sox9 genes have been isolated from a number of teleosts and are called Sox9a and Sox9b. Two Sox9 gene copies have also been isolated from rainbow trout, a salmonid fish and are called Sox9 and Sox9?2. Previous evaluations of the evolutionary history of rainbow trout Sox9 gene copies using phylogenetic reconstructions of their coding regions indicated that they both belong to the Sox9b clade. In this study, we determine the true evolutionary history of Sox9 gene copies in rainbow trout. We show that the locus referred to as Sox9 in rainbow trout is itself duplicated. Mapping of the duplicated Sox9 gene copies indicates that they are co-orthologs of Sox9b while mapping of Sox9?2 indicates that it is an ortholog of Sox9a. This relationship is supported by phylogenetic reconstruction of Sox9 gene copies in teleosts using their 3? untranslated regions. The conflicting phylogenetic topology of Sox9 genes in rainbow trout indicates the occurrence of gene conversion events between Sox9 and Sox9?2 which is supported by a number of recombination analyses.},

The recent application of massively parallel sequencing methods has complemented microarray-based methods and has led to an exponential increase in the discovery of smaller structural-variation events. Some global discovery biases remain, but the integration of experimental and computational approaches is proving fruitful for accurate characterization of the copy, content and structure of variable regions. We argue that the long-term goal should be routine, cost-effective and high quality de novo assembly of human genomes to comprehensively assess all classes of structural variation.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the effect of informative missingness on association tests that use parental genotypes as controls and that allow for missing parental data. Parental data can be informatively missing when the probability of a parent being available for study is related to that parent's genotype; when this occurs, the distribution of genotypes among observed parents is not representative of the distribution of genotypes among the missing parents. Many previously proposed procedures that allow for missing parental data assume that these distributions are the same. We propose association tests that behave well when parental data are informatively missing, under the assumption that, for a given trio of paternal, maternal, and affected offspring genotypes, the genotypes of the parents and the sex of the missing parents, but not the genotype of the affected offspring, can affect parental missingness. (This same assumption is required for validity of an analysis that ignores incomplete parent-offspring trios.) We use simulations to compare our approach with previously proposed procedures, and we show that if even small amounts of informative missingness are not taken into account, they can have large, deleterious effects on the performance of tests.},

  Abstract                 = {A whole genome duplication occurred in the ancestor of all salmonid fishes some 50-100 million years ago. Early inheritance studies with allozymes indicated that loci in the salmonid genome are inherited disomically in females. However, some pairs of duplicated loci showed patterns of inheritance in males indicating pairing and recombination between homeologous chromosomes. Nearly 20% of loci in the salmonid genome are duplicated and share the same alleles (isoloci), apparently due to homeologous recombination. Half-tetrad analysis revealed that isoloci tend to be telomeric. These results suggested that residual tetrasomic inheritance of isoloci results from homeologous recombination near chromosome ends and that continued disomic inheritance resulted from homologous pairing of centromeric regions. Many current genetic maps of salmonids are based on single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites that are no longer duplicated. Therefore, long sections of chromosomes on these maps are poorly represented, especially telomeric regions. In addition, preferential multivalent pairing of homeologs from the same species in F1 hybrids results in an excess of nonparental gametes (so-called pseudolinkage). We consider how not including duplicated loci has affected our understanding of population and evolutionary genetics of salmonids, and we discuss how incorporating these loci will benefit our understanding of population genomics.},

We detected only disomic segregation in females. Segregation ratios in males were best explained by a mixture of disomic and tetrasomic inheritance. We propose a two-stage model of pairing in male meiosis in which, first, homologous chromosomes pair and recombine in the proximal region of the chromosome. Next, homeologous chromosomes pair and recombine distally. We suggest that this type of tetrasomic inheritance in which centromeres segregate disomically should be referred to as "secondary tetrasomy" to distinguish it from tetrasomy involving entire chromosomes (i.e., "primary tetrasomy"). Differences in segregation ratios between males indicate differences between individuals in the amount of recombination between homeologous chromosomes. We also consider the implication of these results for estimation of allele frequencies at duplicated loci in salmonid populations.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Population-level differences in the number of copies of genes resulting from gene duplication and loss have recently been recognized as an important source of variation in eukaryotes. However, except for a small number of cases, the phenotypic effects of this variation are unknown. Data from the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project permit the study of duplication in genome sequences from a set of individuals within the same population. These sequences can be correlated with available information on the environments from which these yeast strains were isolated. We find that yeast show an abundance of duplicate genes that are lineage specific, leading to a large degree of variation in gene content between individual strains. There is a detectable bias for specific functions, indicating that selection is acting to preferentially retain certain duplicates. Most strikingly, we find that sets of over- and underrepresented duplicates correlate with the environment from which they were isolated. Together, these observations indicate that gene duplication can give rise to substantial phenotypic differences within populations that in turn can offer a shortcut to evolutionary adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic resources for hundreds of species of evolutionary, agricultural, economic, and medical importance are unavailable due to the expense of well-assembled genome sequences and difficulties with multigenerational studies. Teleost fish provide many models for human disease but possess anciently duplicated genomes that sometimes obfuscate connectivity. Genomic information representing a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost genome duplication (TGD) would provide an outgroup for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after whole-genome duplication. We exploited massively parallel DNA sequencing to develop meiotic maps with thrift and speed by genotyping F(1) offspring of a single female and a single male spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) collected directly from nature utilizing only polymorphisms existing in these two wild individuals. Using Stacks, software that automates the calling of genotypes from polymorphisms assayed by Illumina sequencing, we constructed a map containing 8406 markers. RNA-seq on two map-cross larvae provided a reference transcriptome that identified nearly 1000 mapped protein-coding markers and allowed genome-wide analysis of conserved synteny. Results showed that the gar lineage diverged from teleosts before the TGD and its genome is organized more similarly to that of humans than teleosts. Thus, spotted gar provides a critical link between medical models in teleost fish, to which gar is biologically similar, and humans, to which gar is genomically similar. Application of our F(1) dense mapping strategy to species with no prior genome information promises to facilitate comparative genomics and provide a scaffold for ordering the numerous contigs arising from next generation genome sequencing.},

Little is known about the population genomic and evolutionary history of this species. We characterized C. elegans genetic variation using high-throughput selective sequencing of a worldwide collection of 200 wild strains and identified 41,188 SNPs. Notably, C. elegans genome variation is dominated by a set of commonly shared haplotypes on four of its six chromosomes, each spanning many megabases. Population genetic modeling showed that this pattern was generated by chromosome-scale selective sweeps that have reduced variation worldwide; at least one of these sweeps probably occurred in the last few hundred years. These sweeps, which we hypothesize to be a result of human activity, have drastically reshaped the global C. elegans population in the recent past.},

  Abstract                 = {Transposable elements (TEs) are discrete genetic units that have the ability to change their location within chromosomal DNA, and constitute a major and rapidly evolving component of eukaryotic genomes. They can be subdivided into 2 distinct types: retrotransposons, which use an RNA intermediate for transposition, and DNA transposons, which move only as DNA. Rapid advances in genome sequencing significantly improved our understanding of TE roles in genome shaping and restructuring, and studies of transcriptomes and epigenomes shed light on the previously unknown molecular mechanisms underlying genetic and epigenetic TE controls. Knowledge of these control systems may be important for better understanding of reticulate evolution and speciation in the context of bringing different genomes together by hybridization and perturbing the established regulatory balance by ploidy changes.

  Abstract                 = {We develop coalescent models for autotetraploid species with tetrasomic inheritance. We show that the ancestral genetic process in a large population without recombination may be approximated using Kingman's standard coalescent, with a coalescent effective population size 4N. Numerical results suggest that this approximation is accurate for population sizes on the order of hundreds of individuals. Therefore, existing coalescent simulation programs can be adapted to study population history in autotetraploids simply by interpreting the timescale in units of 4N generations. We also consider the possibility of double reduction, a phenomenon unique to polysomic inheritance, and show that its effects on gene genealogies are similar to partial self-fertilization.},

  Abstract                 = {Whirling disease, caused by the pathogen Myxobolus cerebralis, leads to skeletal deformation, neurological impairment and under certain conditions, mortality of juvenile salmonid fishes. The disease has impacted the propagation and survival of many salmonid species over six continents, with particularly negative consequences for rainbow trout. To assess the genetic basis of whirling disease resistance in rainbow trout, genome-wide mapping was initiated using a large outbred F(2) rainbow trout family (n=480) and results were confirmed in three additional outbred F(2) families (n=96 per family). A single quantitative trait locus (QTL) region on chromosome Omy9 was identified in the large mapping family and confirmed in all additional families. This region explains 50-86% of the phenotypic variance across families. Therefore, these data establish that a single QTL region is capable of explaining a large percentage of the phenotypic variance contributing to whirling disease resistance. This is the first genetic region discovered that contributes directly to the whirling disease phenotype and the finding moves the field closer to a mechanistic understanding of resistance to this important disease of salmonid fish.},

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Flesh colour and growth related traits in salmonids are both commercially important and of great interest from a physiological and evolutionary perspective. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting flesh colour and growth related traits in an F2 population derived from an isolated, landlocked wild population in Norway (Byglands Bleke) and a commercial production population. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight informative microsatellite loci distributed across all 29 linkage groups in Atlantic salmon were genotyped in individuals from four F2 families that were selected from the ends of the flesh colour distribution. Genotyping of 23 additional loci and two additional families was performed on a number of linkage groups harbouring putative QTL. QTL analysis was performed using a line-cross model assuming fixation of alternate QTL alleles and a half-sib model with no assumptions about the number and frequency of QTL alleles in the founder populations. RESULTS: A moderate to strong phenotypic correlation was found between colour, length and weight traits. In total, 13 genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits using the line-cross model, including three genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour (Chr 6, Chr 26 and Chr 4). In addition, 32 suggestive QTL were detected (chromosome-wide P < 0.05). Using the half-sib model, six genome-wide significant QTL were detected for all traits, including two for flesh colour (Chr 26 and Chr 4) and 41 suggestive QTL were detected (chromosome-wide P < 0.05). Based on the half-sib analysis, these two genome-wide significant QTL for flesh colour explained 24% of the phenotypic variance for this trait. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of significant and suggestive QTL for flesh colour and growth traits were found in an F2 population of Atlantic salmon. Chr 26 and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting flesh colour, while Chr 10, Chr 5, and Chr 4 presented the strongest evidence for significant QTL affecting growth traits (length and weight). These QTL could be strong candidates for use in marker-assisted selection and provide a starting point for further characterisation of the genetic components underlying flesh colour and growth.},

We constructed high-density genetic maps of the silverleaf sunflower (Helianthus argophyllus) and Algodones Dune sunflower (H. niveus ssp. tephrodes) genomes and compared them to a consensus map of cultivated sunflower (H. annuus) to identify chromosomal rearrangements between species. The genetic maps of H. argophyllus and H. niveus ssp. tephrodes included 17 linkage groups each and spanned 1337 and 1478 cM, respectively. Comparative analyses revealed greater divergence between H. annuus and H. niveus ssp. tephrodes (13 inverted segments, 18 translocated segments) than between H. annuus and H. argophyllus (10 inverted segments, 8 translocated segments), consistent with their known phylogenetic relationships. Marker order was conserved across much of the genome, with 83 and 64% of the H. argophyllus and H. niveus ssp. tephrodes genomes, respectively, being syntenic with H. annuus. Population genomic analyses between H. annuus and H. argophyllus, which are sympatric across a portion of the natural range of H. annuus, revealed significantly elevated genetic structure in rearranged portions of the genome, indicating that such rearrangements are associated with restricted gene flow between these two species.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the approximately 250,000 species of flowering plants, nearly one in ten are members of the Compositae (Asteraceae), a diverse family found in almost every habitat on all continents except Antarctica. With an origin in the mid Eocene, the Compositae is also a relatively young family with remarkable diversifications during the last 40 My. Previous cytologic and systematic investigations suggested that paleopolyploidy may have occurred in at least one Compositae lineage, but a recent analysis of genomic data was equivocal. We tested for evidence of paleopolyploidy in the evolutionary history of the family using recently available expressed sequence tag (EST) data from the Compositae Genome Project. Combined with data available on GenBank, we analyzed nearly 1 million ESTs from 18 species representing seven genera and four tribes. Our analyses revealed at least three ancient whole-genome duplications in the Compositae-a paleopolyploidization shared by all analyzed taxa and placed near the origin of the family just prior to the rapid radiation of its tribes and independent genome duplications near the base of the tribes Mutisieae and Heliantheae. These results are consistent with previous research implicating paleopolyploidy in the evolution and diversification of the Heliantheae. Further, we observed parallel retention of duplicate genes from the basal Compositae genome duplication across all tribes, despite divergence times of 33-38 My among these lineages. This pattern of retention was also repeated for the paleologs from the Heliantheae duplication. Intriguingly, the categories of genes retained in duplicate were substantially different from those in Arabidopsis. In particular, we found that genes annotated to structural components or cellular organization Gene Ontology categories were significantly enriched among paleologs, whereas genes associated with transcription and other regulatory functions were significantly underrepresented. Our results suggest that paleopolyploidy can yield strikingly consistent signatures of gene retention in plant genomes despite extensive lineage radiations and recurrent genome duplications but that these patterns vary substantially among higher taxonomic categories.},

  Abstract                 = {Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a major constraint to rainbow trout culture. Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) have greater resistance to this virus than do rainbow trout (O. mykiss), but the genetic mechanism of this resistance is not understood. We conducted a genome scan using a backcross of cutthroat trout into a rainbow trout background to estimate the number and locations of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with IHNV resistance and growth in trout. IHNV resistance was considered in terms of both survival (binary trait) and days to death (quantitative trait). The genetic map was scanned using interval mapping via two different approaches: one model considered survival alone and a second two-part model combined both survival and days to death. Three QTL were significantly (P <= 0.05) associated with virus resistance genome-wide, explaining 32.5% of the phenotypic variation. Cutthroat alleles at two of these QTL resulted in increased resistance to the pathogen, as expected. No growth QTL were detected in this cross. We suggest that these traits are genetically independent. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a powerful new method for targeted sequencing across the genomes of many individuals. This approach has broad potential for genetic analysis of non-model organisms including genotype-phenotype association mapping, phylogeography, population genetics and scaffolding genome assemblies through linkage mapping. We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) backcross that segregated for resistance to the insecticide spinosad. Sequencing of 24 individuals was performed on a single Illumina GAIIx lane (51 base paired-end reads). Taking advantage of the lack of crossing over in homologous chromosomes in female Lepidoptera, 3,177 maternally inherited RAD alleles were assigned to the 31 chromosomes, enabling identification of the spinosad resistance and W/Z sex chromosomes. Paired-end reads for each RAD allele were assembled into contigs and compared to the genome of Bombyx mori (n = 28) using BLAST, revealing 28 homologous matches plus 3 expected fusion/breakage events which account for the difference in chromosome number. A genome-wide linkage map (1292 cM) was inferred with 2,878 segregating RAD alleles inherited from the backcross father, producing chromosome and location specific sequenced RAD markers. Here we have used RAD sequencing to construct a genetic linkage map de novo for an organism that has no previous genome data. Comparative analysis of P. xyloxtella linkage groups with B. mori chromosomes shows for the first time, genetic synteny appears common beyond the Macrolepidoptera. RAD sequencing is a powerful system capable of rapidly generating chromosome specific data for non-model organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {The Pacific Rim population structure of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) was examined with a survey of microsatellite variation to describe the distribution of genetic variation and to evaluate whether chum salmon may have originated from two or more glacial refuges following dispersal to newly available habitat after glacial retreat. Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for over 53,000 chum salmon sampled from over 380 localities ranging from Korea through Washington State. An index of genetic differentiation, F(ST), over all populations and loci was 0.033, with individual locus values ranging from 0.009 to 0.104. The most genetically diverse chum salmon were observed from Asia, particularly Japan, whereas chum salmon from the Skeena River and Queen Charlotte Islands in northern British Columbia and those from Washington State displayed the fewest number of alleles compared with chum salmon in other regions. Differentiation in chum salmon allele frequencies among regions and populations within regions was approximately 18 times greater than that of annual variation within populations. A regional structuring of populations was the general pattern observed, with chum salmon spawning in different tributaries within a major river drainage or spawning in smaller rivers in a geographic area generally more similar to each other than to populations in different major river drainages or geographic areas. Population structure of chum salmon on a Pacific Rim basis supports the concept of a minimum of two refuges, northern and southern, during the last glaciation, but four possible refuges fit better the observed distribution of genetic variation. The distribution of microsatellite variation of chum salmon on a Pacific Rim basis likely reflects the origins of salmon radiating from refuges after the last glaciation period.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of signatures of natural selection in genomic surveys has become an area of intense research, stimulated by the increasing ease with which genetic markers can be typed. Loci identified as subject to selection may be functionally important, and hence (weak) candidates for involvement in disease causation. They can also be useful in determining the adaptive differentiation of populations, and exploring hypotheses about speciation. Adaptive differentiation has traditionally been identified from differences in allele frequencies among different populations, summarised by an estimate of F-ST. Low outliers relative to an appropriate neutral population-genetics model indicate loci subject to balancing selection, whereas high outliers suggest adaptive (directional) selection. However, the problem of identifying statistically significant departures from neutrality is complicated by confounding effects on the distribution of F-ST estimates, and current methods have not yet been tested in large-scale simulation experiments. Here, we simulate data from a structured population at many unlinked, diallelic loci that are predominantly neutral but with some loci subject to adaptive or balancing selection. We develop a hierarchical-Bayesian method, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assess its performance in distinguishing the loci simulated under selection from the neutral loci. We also compare this performance with that of a frequentist method, based on moment-based estimates of F-ST. We find that both methods can identify loci subject to adaptive selection when the selection coefficient is at least five times the migration rate. Neither method could reliably distinguish loci under balancing selection in our simulations, even when the selection coefficient is twenty times the migration rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change has produced disproportionate levels of warming in high latitude ecosystems. A critical challenge is to understand how changes in temperature will mediate ecological processes, such as disease. Several authors have suggested that warming will increase prevalence of diseases at high latitudes, yet long-term studies are lacking. We evaluated how parasite abundance and prevalence in an ecologically and economically important species (juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka) has changed in an Alaskan watershed that has experienced substantial climatic change over the past half-century. We hypothesized that the average increase in summer water temperature of 1.9A degrees C over the past 46 years in our study system would have resulted in a corresponding increase in fish metabolism, and thus potential consumption rates, that would increase infestation rates of the tapeworm Triaenophorus crassus. However, our comparison of data from 1948-1960 to 2008-2009 provided no evidence that the parasite load in juvenile sockeye salmon has significantly changed and that there is no significant relationship between summer temperature and average infestation rates. Climatic projections for southwest Alaska forecast a continuation of the current warming trend, which could potentially have effects on our studied parasite-host interaction, but thus far we found no change in infestation rates over the last 60 years.},

The goal of this review is to provide a general background on research on speciation as it pertains to fishes. Three major components to the question are first discussed: the spatial, ecological and sexual factors that influence speciation mechanisms. We then move to the latest developments in the field of speciation genomics. Affordable and rapidly available, massively parallel sequencing data allow speciation studies to converge into a single comprehensive line of investigation, where the focus has shifted to the search for speciation genes and genomic islands of speciation. We argue that fish present a very diverse array of scenarios, making them an ideal model to study speciation processes.},

Here we show that after 100 million years of evolution the two ancestral subgenomes have remained extremely collinear, despite the loss of half of the duplicated protein-coding genes, mostly through pseudogenization. In striking contrast is the fate of miRNA genes that have almost all been retained as duplicated copies. The slow and stepwise rediploidization process characterized here challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Several genome duplications have occurred in the evolutionary history of teleost fish. In returning to a stable diploid state, the polyploid genome reorganized, and large portions are lost, while the fish lines evolved to numerous species. Large scale transposon movement has been postulated to play an important role in the genome reorganization process. We analyzed the DNA sequence of several large loci in Salmo salar and other species for the presence of DNA transposon families. RESULTS: We have identified bursts of activity of 14 families of DNA transposons (12 Tc1-like and 2 piggyBac-like families, including 11 novel ones) in genome sequences of Salmo salar. Several of these families have similar sequences in a number of closely and distantly related fish, lamprey, and frog species as well as in the parasite Schistosoma japonicum. Analysis of sequence similarities between copies within the families of these bursts demonstrates several waves of transposition activities coinciding with salmonid species divergence. Tc1-like families show a master gene-like copying process, illustrated by extensive but short burst of copying activity, while the piggyBac-like families show a more random copying pattern. Recent families may include copies with an open reading frame for an active transposase enzyme. CONCLUSION: We have identified defined bursts of transposon activity that make use of master-slave and random mechanisms. The bursts occur well after hypothesized polyploidy events and coincide with speciation events. Parasite-mediated lateral transfer of transposons are implicated.},

We recorded 15 morphological landmarks and two skin pigmentation, three growth and three condition traits on parr. The backcross families were genotyped for at least 129 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) within expressed sequence tags (ESTs) spaced throughout the Atlantic salmon linkage map. The high polymorphism and low rates of crossover in our hybrid sires provided enough statistical power to detect 79 significant associations between SNP markers and quantitative traits after experiment-wide permutation analysis for all families within traits. Linkage group AS22 contained a quantitative trait loci (QTL) for parr mark number; its homolog AS24 contained a large QTL, which explained 26% of the phenotypic variance in parr mark contrast. We found 25 highly significant QTLs for body shape and fin position on seven different linkage groups, and 16 for growth and condition on six different linkage groups. QTL(s) for pectoral fin position, caudal peduncle position, late parr growth and condition index were associated with an SNP on linkage group AS1, which was linked to the sex-determining locus. Our work adds to the evidence that much of the variation in growth rate, shape and skin pigmentation observed among Atlantic salmon parr from different natal streams is genetic.},

  Abstract                 = {Wild populations of Atlantic salmon have declined worldwide. While the causes for this decline may be complex and numerous, increased mortality at sea is predicted to be one of the major contributing factors. Examining the potential changes occurring in the genome-wide composition of populations during this migration has the potential to tease apart some of the factors influencing marine mortality. Here, we genotyped 5568 SNPs in Atlantic salmon populations representing two distinct regional genetic groups and across two cohorts to test for differential allelic and genotypic frequencies between juveniles (smolts) migrating to sea and adults (grilses) returning to freshwater after 1 year at sea. Given the complexity of the traits potentially associated with sea mortality, we contrasted the outcomes of a single-locus F(ST) based genome scan method with a new multilocus framework to test for genetically based differential mortality at sea. While numerous outliers were identified by the single-locus analysis, no evidence for parallel, temporally repeated selection was found. In contrast, the multilocus approach detected repeated patterns of selection for a multilocus group of 34 covarying SNPs in one of the two populations. No significant pattern of selective mortality was detected in the other population, suggesting different causes of mortality among populations. These results first support the hypothesis that selection mainly causes small changes in allele frequencies among many covarying loci rather than a small number of changes in loci with large effects. They also point out that moving away from the a strict 'selective sweep paradigm' towards a multilocus genetics framework may be a more useful approach for studying the genomic signatures of natural selection on complex traits in wild populations.},

Infections are initially localized in the kidney but have recently been associated with branchitis in one population. Adult fish from five locations in the watershed were sampled to determine whether branchitis was widespread. P. minibicornis infections in kidney glomeruli were prevalent in all samples except for a sample of fish that had just entered the Fraser River from the ocean. For fish captured in spawning streams, parasites were observed in the renal tubules and gill, and branchitis was observed in 70% of fish. Plasma osmolality was negatively correlated with the number of parasites in the kidney tubules, which we hypothesize to be caused by the breach of glomerular membranes as the parasite leaves the fish. Plasma lactate values increased with increasing levels of pathology in gills. These findings support the hypothesis that P. minibicornis impacts the physiology of migrating fish, which may in turn affect the likelihood that adults will be able to migrate and spawn successfully.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Geographical isolation has generated a distinct difference between Atlantic salmon of European and North American Atlantic origin. The European Atlantic salmon generally has 29 pairs of chromosomes and 74 chromosome arms whereas it has been reported that the North American Atlantic salmon has 27 chromosome pairs and an NF of 72. In order to predict the major chromosomal rearrangements causing these differences, we constructed a dense linkage map for Atlantic salmon of North American origin and compared it with the well-developed map for European Atlantic salmon. RESULTS: The presented male and female genetic maps for the North American subspecies of Atlantic salmon, contains 3,662 SNPs located on 27 linkage groups. The total lengths of the female and male linkage maps were 2,153 cM and 968 cM respectively, with males characteristically showing recombination only at the telomeres. We compared these maps with recently published SNP maps from European Atlantic salmon, and predicted three chromosomal reorganization events that we then tested using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The proposed rearrangements, which define the differences in the karyotypes of the North American Atlantic salmon relative to the European Atlantic salmon, include the translocation of the p arm of ssa01 to ssa23 and polymorphic fusions: ssa26 with ssa28, and ssa08 with ssa29. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified major chromosomal differences between European and North American Atlantic salmon. However, while gross structural differences were significant, the order of genetic markers at the fine-resolution scale was remarkably conserved. This is a good indication that information from the International Cooperation to Sequence the Atlantic salmon Genome, which is sequencing a European Atlantic salmon, can be transferred to Atlantic salmon from North America.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparisons between the genomes of salmon species reveal that they underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements following whole genome duplication that occurred in their lineage 58-63 million years ago. Extant salmonids are diploid, but occasional pairing between homeologous chromosomes exists in males. The consequences of re-diploidization can be characterized by mapping the position of duplicated loci in such species. Linkage maps are also a valuable tool for genome-wide applications such as genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait loci mapping or genome scans. Here, we investigated chromosomal evolution in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) after genome duplication by mapping 7146 restriction-site associated DNA loci in gynogenetic haploid, gynogenetic diploid, and diploid crosses. In the process, we developed a reference database of restriction-site associated DNA loci for Chinook salmon comprising 48528 non-duplicated loci and 6409 known duplicated loci, which will facilitate locus identification and data sharing. We created a very dense linkage map anchored to all 34 chromosomes for the species, and all arms were identified through centromere mapping. The map positions of 799 duplicated loci revealed that homeologous pairs have diverged at different rates following whole genome duplication, and that degree of differentiation along arms was variable. Many of the homeologous pairs with high numbers of duplicated markers appear conserved with other salmon species, suggesting that retention of conserved homeologous pairing in some arms preceded species divergence. As chromosome arms are highly conserved across species, the major resources developed for Chinook salmon in this study are also relevant for other related species.},

Overwhelming evidence was found for strong positive crossover interference, with average strength lying between the levels of interference implied by the Kosambi and Carter-Falconer map functions. Five mathematical models of interference were evaluated: the gamma model and four versions of the count-location model. The gamma model fit the data far better than did any of the other four models. Analysis of intercrossover distances was greatly superior to the analysis of crossover counts, in both demonstrating interference and distinguishing between the five models. In contrast to earlier suggestions, interference was found to continue uninterrupted across the centromeres. No convincing differences in the levels of interference were found between the sexes or among chromosomes; however, we did detect possible individual variation in interference among the eight mothers. Finally, we present an equation that provides the probability of the occurrence of a double crossover between two nonrecombinant, informative polymorphisms.},

Early theorists proposed that chromosome rearrangements were implicated in the process of reproductive isolation; however, the chromosomal speciation model has recently been questioned. In addition, recent data from hybrid model systems indicates that simple epistatic interactions, the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, are more complex. In fact, incompatibilities are quite broad, including interactions among heterochromatin, small RNAs, and distinct, epigenetically defined genomic regions such as the centromere. In this review, we will examine both classical and current models of chromosomal speciation and describe the "evolving" theory of genetic conflict, epigenetics, and chromosomal speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Teleost fishes provide the first unambiguous support for ancient whole-genome duplication in an animal lineage. Studies in yeast or plants have shown that the effects of such duplications can be mediated by a complex pattern of gene retention and changes in evolutionary pressure. To explore such patterns in fishes, we have determined by phylogenetic analysis the evolutionary origin of 675 Tetraodon duplicated genes assigned to chromosomes, using additional data from other species of actinopterygian fishes. The subset of genes, which was retained in double after the genome duplication, is enriched in development, signaling, behavior, and regulation functional categories. The evolutionary rate of duplicate fish genes appears to be determined by 3 forces: 1) fish proteins evolve faster than mammalian orthologs; 2) the genes kept in double after genome duplication represent the subset under strongest purifying selection; and 3) following duplication, there is an asymmetric acceleration of evolutionary rate in one of the paralogs. These results show that similar mechanisms are at work in fishes as in yeast or plants and provide a framework for future investigation of the consequences of duplication in fishes and other animals.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have potential for broad application in population and conservation genetics, but availability of these markers is limited in many nonmodel species. In this study, genomic and expressed sequence tagged (EST) sequences from closely related salmonids (Chinook salmon and rainbow trout) were used to design primers for amplification and sequencing of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon DNA for SNP discovery. One hundred and six primer sets were designed and tested for amplification in each species. An ascertainment panel of 32 diverse individuals from each species was used as template for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. In total, 21,647 bases of consensus sequence were screened in sockeye salmon and 20,784 bases in coho salmon with 93 and 149 SNP sites identified, respectively. Sixty-four SNP sites were chosen for assay development, and 54 of the assays were validated by comparison with genotype and sequence data (O. nerka = 23; O. kisutch = 31). These validated SNP assays along with 142 other available SNP assays [O. nerka = 103 (126 total); O. kisutch = 30 (61 total)] were used to genotype collections of O. nerka (N = 5) and O. kisutch (N = 4) from various sites in the Columbia River to evaluate the utility of these markers in this region. Results from factorial correspondence analysis indicate that these SNP markers are capable of distinguishing O. nerka populations, but O. kisutch collections were less distinct because of their common ancestry.},

Stacks now produces core population genomic summary statistics and SNP-by-SNP statistical tests. These statistics can be analysed across a reference genome using a smoothed sliding window. Stacks also now provides several output formats for several commonly used downstream analysis packages. The expanded population genomics functions in Stacks will make it a useful tool to harness the newest generation of massively parallel genotyping data for ecological and evolutionary genetics.},

From reduced representation Illumina sequence data, such as RAD-tags, Stacks can recover thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers useful for the genetic analysis of crosses or populations. Stacks can generate markers for ultra-dense genetic linkage maps, facilitate the examination of population phylogeography, and help in reference genome assembly. We report here the algorithms implemented in Stacks and demonstrate their efficacy by constructing loci from simulated RAD-tags taken from the stickleback reference genome and by recapitulating and improving a genetic map of the zebrafish, Danio rerio.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene duplication provides a window of opportunity for biological variants to persist under the protection of a co-expressed copy with similar or redundant function. Duplication catalyzes innovation (neofunctionalization), subfunction degeneration (subfunctionalization), and genetic buffering (redundancy), and the genetic survival of each paralog is triggered by mechanisms that add, compromise, or do not alter protein function. We tested the applicability of three types of mechanisms for promoting the retained expression of duplicated genes in 290 expressed paralogs of the tetraploid clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Tests were based on explicit expectations concerning the ka/ks ratio, and the number and location of nonsynonymous substitutions after duplication. Functional constraints on the majority of paralogs are not significantly different from a singleton ortholog. However, we recover strong support that some of them have an asymmetric rate of nonsynonymous substitution: 6% match predictions of the neofunctionalization hypothesis in that (1) each paralog accumulated nonsynonymous substitutions at a significantly different rate and (2) the one that evolves faster has a higher ka/ks ratio than the other paralog and than a singleton ortholog. Fewer paralogs (3%) exhibit a complementary pattern of substitution at the protein level that is predicted by enhancement or degradation of different functional domains, and the remaining 13% have a higher average ka/ks ratio in both paralogs that is consistent with altered functional constraints, diversifying selection, or activity-reducing mutations after duplication. We estimate that these paralogs have been retained since they originated by genome duplication between 21 and 41 million years ago. Multiple mechanisms operate to promote the retained expression of duplicates in the same genome, in genes in the same functional class, over the same period of time following duplication, and sometimes in the same pair of paralogs. None of these paralogs are superfluous; degradation or enhancement of different protein subfunctions and neofunctionalization are plausible hypotheses for the retained expression of some of them. Evolution of most X. laevis paralogs, however, is consistent with retained expression via mechanisms that do not radically alter functional constraints, such as selection to preserve post-duplication stoichiometry or temporal, quantitative, or spatial subfunctionalization.},

  Abstract                 = {The estimation of genetic linkage maps is a key component in plant and animal research, providing both an indication of the genetic structure of an organism and a mechanism for identifying candidate genes associated with traits of interest. Because of this importance, several computational solutions to genetic map estimation exist, mostly implemented as stand-alone software packages. However, the estimation process is often largely hidden from the user. Consequently, problems such as a program crashing may occur that leave a user baffled. THREaD Mapper Studio (http://cbr.jic.ac.uk/threadmapper) is a new web site that implements a novel, visual and interactive method for the estimation of genetic linkage maps from DNA markers. The rationale behind the web site is to make the estimation process as transparent and robust as possible, while also allowing users to use their expert knowledge during analysis. Indeed, the 3D visual nature of the tool allows users to spot features in a data set, such as outlying markers and potential structural rearrangements that could cause problems with the estimation procedure and to account for them in their analysis. Furthermore, THREaD Mapper Studio facilitates the visual comparison of genetic map solutions from third party software, aiding users in developing robust solutions for their data sets.},

Our method considers both linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and the constraints imposed by family structure when assigning individual genotypes and haplotypes. Using simulations, we show that trios provide higher genotype calling accuracy across the frequency spectrum, both overall and at hard-to-call heterozygous sites. In addition, trios provide greatly improved phasing accuracy--improving the accuracy of downstream analyses (such as genotype imputation) that rely on phased haplotypes. To further evaluate our approach, we analyzed data on the first 508 individuals sequenced by the SardiNIA sequencing project. Our results show that our method reduces the genotyping error rate by 50% compared with analysis using existing methods that ignore family structure. We anticipate our method will facilitate genotype calling and haplotype inference for many ongoing sequencing projects.},

Unannotated, nonpolyadenylated transcripts comprise the major proportion of the transcriptional output of the human genome. Of all transcribed sequences, 19.4, 43.7, and 36.9% were observed to be polyadenylated, nonpolyadenylated, and bimorphic, respectively. Half of all transcribed sequences are found only in the nucleus and for the most part are unannotated. Overall, the transcribed portions of the human genome are predominantly composed of interlaced networks of both poly A+ and poly A- annotated transcripts and unannotated transcripts of unknown function. This organization has important implications for interpreting genotype-phenotype associations, regulation of gene expression, and the definition of a gene.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Linkage maps are an integral resource for dissection of complex genetic traits in plant and animal species. Canonical map construction follows a well-established workflow: an initial discovery phase where genetic markers are mined from a small pool of individuals, followed by genotyping of selected mapping populations using sets of marker panels. A newly developed sequence-based marker technology, Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD), enables synchronous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker discovery and genotyping using massively parallel sequencing. The objective of this research was to assess the utility of RAD markers for linkage map construction, employing barley as a model system. Using the published high density EST-based SNP map in the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population as a reference, we created a RAD map using a limited set of prior markers to establish linakge group identity, integrated the RAD and prior data, and used both maps for detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL). RESULTS: Using the RAD protocol in tandem with the Illumina sequence by synthesis platform, a total of 530 SNP markers were identified from initial scans of the OWB parental inbred lines--the "dominant" and "recessive" marker stocks--and scored in a 93 member doubled haploid (DH) mapping population. RAD sequence data from the structured population was converted into allele genotypes from which a genetic map was constructed. The assembled RAD-only map consists of 445 markers with an average interval length of 5 cM, while an integrated map includes 463 RAD loci and 2383 prior markers. Sequenced RAD markers are distributed across all seven chromosomes, with polymorphic loci emanating from both coding and noncoding regions in the Hordeum genome. Total map lengths are comparable and the order of common markers is identical in both maps. The same large-effect QTL for reproductive fitness traits were detected with both maps and the majority of these QTL were coincident with a dwarfing gene (ZEO) and the VRS1 gene, which determines the two-row and six-row germplasm groups of barley. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate how sequenced RAD markers can be leveraged to produce high quality linkage maps for detection of single gene loci and QTLs. By combining SNP discovery and genotyping into parallel sequencing events, RAD markers should be a useful molecular breeding tool for a range of crop species. Expected improvements in cost and throughput of second and third-generation sequencing technologies will enable more powerful applications of the sequenced RAD marker system, including improvements in de novo genome assembly, development of ultra-high density genetic maps and association mapping.},

In this study, microsatellite markers linked and unlinked to SPT-QTLs were genotyped to investigate the underlying genetics of this trait. SPT-QTLs influenced the DARC trait since in two case-control comparisons three linked markers (OmyFGT12TUF, One3ASC and One19ASC) had significant levels of allelic frequency differentiation and marker-character association. Furthermore, alleles of One3ASC and One19ASC had significantly higher frequencies in populations that carried the DARC trait.},

More specifically, it has been assumed that the centromere acts as a barrier to the transmission of interference, so that a chiasma in the vicinity of a centromere would not affect the probability of chiasma formation across at this point. Some statistical analyses seemed to ratify this supposition. However, a reassessment of the literature led us to the conclusion that the statistical analyses that were not flawed were consistent in showing that interference may act across the centromere. Using large sets of chiasma data from the grasshoppers Leptysma argentina and Chorthippus brunneus and applying statistical approaches that involved either the calculation of coincidence or correlating the distances between the centromere and the nearest chiasma in either arm, it is concluded: 1. that interference acts across the centromere; 2. that the action of interference is not changed by the presence of an intervening centromere.},

Studies of polyploids soon after their formation have revealed genetic and epigenetic interactions between redundant genes. These interactions can be related to the phenotypes and evolutionary fates of polyploids. Here, I consider the advantages and challenges of polyploidy, and its evolutionary potential.},

Genomic data suggest that different gene classes tend to be retained after single-gene and whole-genome duplications. We also know that functional differences between duplicate genes can originate in several different ways, including mutations that directly impart new functions, subdivision of ancestral functions and selection for changes in gene dosage. Interestingly, in many cases the 'new' function of one copy is a secondary property that was always present, but that has been co-opted to a primary role after the duplication.},

  Abstract                 = {Loci involved in local adaptation can potentially be identified by an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global F(ST).

  Abstract                 = {SNP genotyping has emerged as a technology to incorporate copy number variants (CNVs) into genetic analyses of human traits. However, the extent to which SNP platforms accurately capture CNVs remains unclear. Using independent, sequence-based CNV maps, we find that commonly used SNP platforms have limited or no probe coverage for a large fraction of CNVs. Despite this, in 9 samples we inferred 368 CNVs using Illumina SNP genotyping data and experimentally validated over two-thirds of these. We also developed a method (SNP-Conditional Mixture Modeling, SCIMM) to robustly genotype deletions using as few as two SNP probes. We find that HapMap SNPs are strongly correlated with 82% of common deletions, but the newest SNP platforms effectively tag about 50%. We conclude that currently available genome-wide SNP assays can capture CNVs accurately, but improvements in array designs, particularly in duplicated sequences, are necessary to facilitate more comprehensive analyses of genomic variation.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of epistasis--non-additive interactions between alleles--in shaping population fitness has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part by lack of empirical evidence. Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis of non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given trait. However, epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic footprint. To capture this signal, we have developed a simple approach that relies on detecting genotype ratio distortion as a sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large panel of Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines. Here we confirm experimentally that instances of genotype ratio distortion represent loci with epistatic fitness effects; we conservatively estimate that any two haploid genomes in this study are expected to harbour 1.15 pairs of epistatically interacting alleles. This observation has important implications for speciation genetics, as it indicates that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require, as proposed by the Dobzhansky-Muller model, the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. The relevance of our result extends beyond speciation, as it demonstrates that epistasis is widespread but that it may often go undetected owing to lack of statistical power or lack of genome-wide scope of the experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Considerable research efforts have focused on elucidating the systematic relationships among salmonid fishes; an understanding of these patterns of relatedness will inform conservation- and fisheries-related issues, as well as provide a framework for investigating evolutionary mechanisms in the group. However, uncertainties persist in current Salmonidae phylogenies due to biological and methodological factors, and a comprehensive phylogeny including most representatives of the family could provide insight into the causes of these difficulties. Here we increase taxon sampling by including nearly all described salmonid species (n = 63) to present a time-calibrated and more complete portrait of Salmonidae using a combination of molecular markers and analytical techniques. This strategy improved resolution by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and helped discriminate methodological and systematic errors from sources of difficulty associated with biological processes. Our results highlight novel aspects of salmonid evolution. First, we call into question the widely-accepted evolutionary relationships among sub-families and suggest that Thymallinae, rather than Coregoninae, is the sister group to the remainder of Salmonidae. Second, we find that some groups in Salmonidae are older than previously thought and that the mitochondrial rate of molecular divergence varies markedly among genes and clades. We estimate the age of the family to be 59.1 MY (CI: 63.2-58.1 MY) old, which likely corresponds to the timing of whole genome duplication in salmonids. The average, albeit highly variable, mitochondrial rate of molecular divergence was estimated as ~0.31%/MY (CI: 0.27-0.36%/MY). Finally, we suggest that some species require taxonomic revision, including two monotypic genera, Stenodus and Salvethymus. In addition, we resolve some relationships that have been notoriously difficult to discern and present a clearer picture of the evolution of the group. Our findings represent an important contribution to the systematics of Salmonidae, and provide a useful tool for addressing questions related to fundamental and applied evolutionary issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Salmon life histories are finely tuned to local environmental conditions, which are intimately linked to climate. We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i.e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {The plight of the Snake River sockeye salmon presents a challenging genetic puzzle for conservation biologists. Although the Snake River sockeye has been declared endangered, assessment of captive breeding strategies are complicated because a healthy non-migratory strain of O. nerka (kokanee) resides in Redfish Lake, Idaho-the same lake the anadromous fish return to for spawning. The migration of 1-year-old fish (outmigrants) from the lake each year and the observation of non-migratory fish spawning in areas previously used by the sockeye further complicate the issue. We estimated the relatedness of these strains by direct examination of their genetic similarity. Mixed DNA fingerprint analyses suggested that the outmigrants were more closely related to the anadromous sockeye than to the kokane. Closer analysis using a probe, One-H0.8, to examine allele frequencies at a single locus revealed polymorphism in a number of O. necka populations. Within the Redfish Lake populations this probe detected an allele present at 0.21 frequency in the kokanee (n = 43), 0.01 (n = 324) in the outmigrants, and absent among 13 anadromous fish. These results support a close genetic relationship of the outmigrants to the anadromous sockeye and the probable utility of the outmigrants in a captive breeding program to restore the anadromous strain.},

A recent study has analyzed the link between BBH and orthology in bacteria and archaea and concluded that, given the very high consistency in BBH they observed among triplets of neighboring genes, a high proportion of BBH are likely to be bona fide orthologs. However, limited by their analysis setup, the previous study could not easily test the reverse question: which proportion of orthologs are BBH? In this follow-up study, we consider this question in theory and answer it based on conceptual arguments, simulated data, and real biological data from all three domains of life. Our analyses corroborate the findings of the previous study, but also show that because of the high rate of gene duplication in plants and animals, as much as 60% of orthologous relations are missed by the BBH criterion.},

  Abstract                 = {We updated the genetic map of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) for 2 outcrossed mapping panels, and used this map to assess the putative chromosome structure and recombination rate differences among linkage groups. We then used the rainbow trout sex-specific maps to make comparisons with 2 other ancestrally polyploid species of salmonid fishes, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to identify homeologous chromosome affinities within each species and ascertain homologous chromosome relationships among the species. Salmonid fishes exhibit a wide range of sex-specific differences in recombination rate, with some species having the largest differences for any vertebrate species studied to date. Our current estimate of female:male recombination rates in rainbow trout is 4.31:1. Chromosome structure and (or) size is associated with recombination rate differences between the sexes in rainbow trout. Linkage groups derived from presumptive acrocentric type chromosomes were observed to have much lower sex-specific differences in recombination rate than metacentric type linkage groups. Arctic charr is karyotypically the least derived species (i.e., possessing a high number of acrocentric chromosomes) and Atlantic salmon is the most derived (i.e., possessing a number of whole-arm fusions). Atlantic salmon have the largest female:male recombination ratio difference (i.e., 16.81:1) compared with rainbow trout, and Arctic charr (1.69:1). Comparisons of recombination rates between homologous segments of linkage groups among species indicated that when significant experiment-wise differences were detected (7/24 tests), recombination rates were generally higher in the species with a less-derived chromosome structure (6/7 significant comparisons). Greater similarity in linkage group syntenies were observed between Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, suggesting their closer phylogenetic affinities, and most interspecific linkage group comparisons support a model that suggests whole chromosome arm translocations have occurred in the evolution of this group. However, some possible exceptions were detected and these findings are discussed in relation to their influence on segregation distortion patterns. We also report unusual meiotic segregation patterns in a female parent involving the duplicated (homeologous) linkage group pair 12/16 and discuss several models that may account for these patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Comparative genomic studies suggest that the modern day assemblage of ray-finned fishes have descended from an ancestral grouping of fishes that possessed 12-13 linkage groups. All jawed vertebrates are postulated to have experienced two whole genome duplications (WGD) in their ancestry (2R duplication). Salmonids have experienced one additional WGD (4R duplication event) compared to most extant teleosts which underwent a further 3R WGD compared to other vertebrates. We describe the organization of the 4R chromosomal segments of the proto-ray-finned fish karyotype in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout based upon their comparative syntenies with two model species of 3R ray-finned fishes. RESULTS: Evidence is presented for the retention of large whole-arm affinities between the ancestral linkage groups of the ray-finned fishes, and the 50 homeologous chromosomal segments in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. In the comparisons between the two salmonid species, there is also evidence for the retention of large whole-arm homeologous affinities that are associated with the retention of duplicated markers. Five of the 7 pairs of chromosomal arm regions expressing the highest level of duplicate gene expression in rainbow trout share homologous synteny to the 5 pairs of homeologs with the greatest duplicate gene expression in Atlantic salmon. These regions are derived from proto-Actinopterygian linkage groups B, C, E, J and K. CONCLUSION: Two chromosome arms in Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes (descendants of the 3R duplication) can, in most instances be related to at least 4 whole or partial chromosomal arms in the salmonid species. Multiple arm assignments in the two salmonid species do not clearly support a 13 proto-linkage group model, and suggest that a 12 proto-linkage group arrangement (i.e., a separate single chromosome duplication and ancestral fusion/fissions/recombination within the putative G/H/I groupings) may have occurred in the more basal soft-rayed fishes. We also found evidence supporting the model that ancestral linkage group M underwent a single chromosome duplication following the 3R duplication. In the salmonids, the M ancestral linkage groups are localized to 5 whole arm, and 3 partial arm regions (i.e., 6 whole arm regions expected). Thus, 3 distinct ancestral linkage groups are postulated to have existed in the G/H and M lineage chromosomes in the ancestor of the salmonids.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic research in fishes is poised to contribute a vast amount of information on the structural organization and function of vertebrate genomes. Recent advances in molecular biology have made possible the widescale characterization of genomes in all living organisms. This includes defining chromosomes at the cytological level down to their linear composition at individual nucleotide base pairs. Pioneering gene mapping studies into the genomes of fishes will only serve as the starting point for more detailed studies into the function of these genomes. Future research directed at understanding the mechanisms of gene actions and interactions will benefit all areas of biology, including ecology, ethology, evolution, and physiology. Gene mapping data from brown trout and rainbow trout are used to exemplify how basic information on gene transmission in a species may help to localize centromeres onto a genetic map and identify chromosomal regions possessing a high degree of segregation distortion. Genetic maps may also be used to identify differences in recombination levels among individuals and between the sexes when multiple mapping families are utilized in studies. Observations of this type are the antecedents to more complex biological investigations on the genetic architecture underlying these phenomena.},

As with other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, RAD-Seq produces stochastic count data and requires sensitive analysis to develop or genotype markers accurately. We show that there are several sources of bias specific to RAD-Seq that are not explicitly addressed by current genotyping tools, namely restriction fragment bias, restriction site heterozygosity and PCR GC content bias. We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD-Seq data. While these biases need to be taken seriously, we believe RAD loci affected by them can be excluded or processed with relative ease in most cases and that most RAD loci will be accurately genotyped by existing tools.},

We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of all gene families from the complete gene sets of a tunicate, fish, mouse, and human, and then determined when each gene duplicated relative to the evolutionary tree of the organisms. We confirmed the results of earlier studies that there remains little signal of these events in numbers of duplicated genes, gene tree topology, or the number of genes per multigene family. However, when we plotted the genomic map positions of only the subset of paralogous genes that were duplicated prior to the fish-tetrapod split, their global physical organization provides unmistakable evidence of two distinct genome duplication events early in vertebrate evolution indicated by clear patterns of four-way paralogous regions covering a large part of the human genome. Our results highlight the potential for these large-scale genomic events to have driven the evolutionary success of the vertebrate lineage.},

  Abstract                 = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are famous for their homing migrations from oceanic feeding grounds to their natal river to spawn. During these migrations, salmon travel through diverse habitats (e.g. oceans, lakes, rivers), each offering distinct orientation clues and, perhaps, requiring distinct sensory capabilities for navigation. Despite these challenges, homing is generally precise and this philopatry has resulted in reproductively isolated spawning populations with specialized adaptations for their natal habitat. This paper reviews the mechanisms underlying all aspects of salmon homing but emphasizes the final, freshwater phase governed by olfactory recognition of homestream water. Prior to their seaward migration, juvenile salmon learn (imprint on) odors associated with their natal site and later, as adults, use these odor memories for homing. Our understanding of this imprinting process is derived primarily from studies using artificial odorants and hatchery-reared salmon. Recent findings suggest, however, that such studies may underestimate the complexity of the imprinting process in nature.},

  Abstract                 = {In salmonid fishes, the tendency to return to the natal site for breeding leads to reproductively isolated, locally adapted populations. In addition to this isolation-by-space, the heritability of breeding date can result in temporal segregation or isolation of breeding units. We examined the interaction between breeding location (spatial segregation) and arrival date (temporal segregation) for two fitness-related traits, reproductive life span and body size, of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) in a small Alaskan stream. Analysis of data on tagged individuals over 9 years revealed that both males and females arriving early to the spawning grounds tended to spawn farther upstream than those arriving later, demonstrating the potential for segregation in time and space within the population. Both body length and reproductive life span also consistently varied with arrival date. Larger males and females entered the stream before smaller individuals, and individuals of both sexes that arrived early lived longer in the stream than those that arrived later, However, neither reproductive life span nor body size varied significantly with breeding location, indicating that the linkage between spatial and temporal structure in this breeding population is incomplete, and that segregation in time may currently be the dominant component of within-population structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variation in sensitivity to stress is a major determinant of production and welfare of aquaculture species. We investigated the genetics of the stress response using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) clonal tines with differing levels of domestication. First, we compared levels of cortisol among three clonal lines: two derived from highly domesticated populations (Arlee and OSU) and one from a population recently taken into captivity (Swanson). The Arlee clonal line showed significantly reduced cortisol levels in response to a netting stressor relative to the OSU and Swanson clonal lines. Next, we used interval mapping and composite interval mapping to scan the genome for quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing post-stress cortisol levels in doubled haploid offspring of an OSU x Arlee hybrid and compared these to QTL for body mass. Two significant QTL with opposing additive effects on cortisol levels were detected, explaining 43% of the phenotypic variation. Two QTL were also detected for juvenile body mass, one of which overlapped with a QTL for cortisol levels on linkage group OA-XXVII, indicating a possible genetic link between these traits. However, the additive effects of these overlapping QTL suggest a positive relationship between cortisol levels and growth rate rather than the expected negative relationship. Our findings suggest complex genetic control of stress physiology and its relationship with growth rate. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a considerable impetus in population genomics to pinpoint loci involved in local adaptation. A powerful approach to find genomic regions subject to local adaptation is to genotype numerous molecular markers and look for outlier loci. One of the most common approaches for selection scans is based on statistics that measure population differentiation such as FST. However, there are important caveats with approaches related to FST because they require grouping individuals into populations and they additionally assume a particular model of population structure. Here, we implement a more flexible individual-based approach based on Bayesian factor models. Factor models capture population structure with latent variables called factors, which can describe clustering of individuals into populations or isolation-by-distance patterns. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we both infer population structure and identify outlier loci that are candidates for local adaptation. In order to identify outlier loci, the hierarchical factor model searches for loci that are atypically related to population structure as measured by the latent factors. In a model of population divergence, we show that it can achieve a 2-fold or more reduction of false discovery rate compared with the software BayeScan or with an FST approach. We show that our software can handle large data sets by analyzing the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Human Genome Diversity Project. The Bayesian factor model is implemented in the open-source PCAdapt software.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid population genetics. These gaps arise from the complex nature of polyploid data (e.g. multiple alleles and loci, mixed inheritance patterns, association between ploidy and mating system variation). Furthermore, many of the standard tools for population genetics that have been developed for diploids are often not feasible for polyploids. This review aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in polyploid population genetics and to identify the main areas where further development of molecular techniques and statistical theory is required. We review commonly used molecular tools (amplified fragment length polymorphism, microsatellites, Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing and derived technologies) and their challenges associated with their use in polyploid populations: that is, allele dosage determination, null alleles, difficulty of distinguishing orthologues from paralogues and copy number variation. In addition, we review the approaches that have been used for population genetic analysis in polyploids and their specific problems. These problems are in most cases directly associated with dosage uncertainty and the problem of inferring allele frequencies and assumptions regarding inheritance. This leads us to conclude that for advancing the field of polyploid population genetics, most priority should be given to development of new molecular approaches that allow efficient dosage determination, and to further development of analytical approaches to circumvent dosage uncertainty and to accommodate 'flexible' modes of inheritance. In addition, there is a need for more simulation-based studies that test what kinds of biases could result from both existing and novel approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic architecture underlying variation in embryonic developmental rate (DR) and genetic covariation with age of maturation (MAT) was investigated in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Highly significant additive parental effects and more limited evidence of epistatic effects on progeny hatching time were detected in three diallel sets of families. Genome scans with an average of 142 microsatellite loci from all 29 linkage groups in two families detected significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for developmental rate on RT-8 and RT-30 with genome-wide and chromosome-wide effects, respectively. The QTL on linkage group RT-8 explained 23.7% of the phenotypic variation and supports results from previous studies. The co-localization of QTL for both DR and MAT to several linkage groups and the observation that alleles associated with faster developmental rate were found significantly more often in early maturing rather than typical and later maturing male ancestors supports the hypothesis of genetic covariation between DR and MAT. The maturation background and schedule of additional sires, however, did not have a consistent association with their progeny hatching times, suggesting that other genetic, environmental and physiological effects contribute to variation in these life-history traits.},

  Abstract                 = {The development and application of genomic tools to loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) offer promising insights into the organization and structure of conifer genomes. The application of a high-throughput genotyping assay across diverse forest tree species, however, is currently limited taxonomically. This is despite the ongoing development of genome-scale projects aiming at the construction of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries and the resequencing of EST-derived unigenes for a diverse array of forest tree species. In this paper, we report on the application of Illumina's high-throughput GoldenGate (TM) SNP genotyping assay to a loblolly pine mapping population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified through resequencing of previously identified wood quality, drought tolerance, and disease resistance candidate genes prior to genotyping. From that effort, a 384 multiplexed SNP assay was developed for high-throughput genotyping. Approximately 67% of the 384 SNPs queried converted into high-quality genotypes for the 48 progeny samples. Of those 257 successfully genotyped SNPs, 70 were segregating within the mapping population. A total of 27 candidate genes were subsequently mapped onto the existing loblolly pine consensus map, which consists of 12 linkage groups spanning a total map distance of 1,227.6 cM. The ability of SNPs to be mapped to the same position as fragment-based markers previously developed within the same candidate genes, as well as the pivotal role that SNPs currently play in the dissection of complex phenotypic traits, illustrate the usefulness of high-throughput SNP genotyping technologies to the continued development of pine genomics.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change-induced increases in summer water temperature have been associated with elevated mortality of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during river migration. We show that cardiorespiratory physiology varies at the population level among Fraser River sockeye salmon and relates to historical environmental conditions encountered while migrating. Fish from populations with more challenging migratory environments have greater aerobic scope, larger hearts, and better coronary supply. Furthermore, thermal optima for aerobic, cardiac, and heart rate scopes are consistent with the historic river temperature ranges for each population. This study suggests that physiological adaptation occurs at a very local scale, with population-specific thermal limits being set by physiological limitations in aerobic performance, possibly due to cardiac collapse at high temperatures.},

  Abstract                 = {Unravelling the genomic landscape of divergence between lineages is key to understanding speciation. The naturally hybridizing collared flycatcher and pied flycatcher are important avian speciation models that show pre- as well as postzygotic isolation. We sequenced and assembled the 1.1-Gb flycatcher genome, physically mapped the assembly to chromosomes using a low-density linkage map and re-sequenced population samples of each species. Here we show that the genomic landscape of species differentiation is highly heterogeneous with approximately 50 'divergence islands' showing up to 50-fold higher sequence divergence than the genomic background. These non-randomly distributed islands, with between one and three regions of elevated divergence per chromosome irrespective of chromosome size, are characterized by reduced levels of nucleotide diversity, skewed allele-frequency spectra, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium and reduced proportions of shared polymorphisms in both species, indicative of parallel episodes of selection. Proximity of divergence peaks to genomic regions resistant to sequence assembly, potentially including centromeres and telomeres, indicate that complex repeat structures may drive species divergence. A much higher background level of species divergence of the Z chromosome, and a lower proportion of shared polymorphisms, indicate that sex chromosomes and autosomes are at different stages of speciation. This study provides a roadmap to the emerging field of speciation genomics.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

Here, we illustrate this point using a low-cost, efficient technique to determine the fine-scale phylogenetic relationships among recently diverged populations in a species. This application of restriction site-associated DNA tags (RAD tags) reveals previously unresolved genetic structure and direction of evolution in the pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from a southern Appalachian Mountain refugium following recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at 22,000-19,000 B.P. The RAD tag method can be used to identify detailed patterns of phylogeography in any organism regardless of existing genomic data, and, more broadly, to identify incipient speciation and genome-wide variation in natural populations in general.},

We use this RAD-PE contig approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and determine haplotype structure in threespine stickleback and to sequence E. coli and stickleback genomic DNA with overlapping contigs of several hundred nucleotides. We also demonstrate that adding a circularization step allows the local assembly of contigs up to 5 kilobases (kb) in length. The ease of assembly and accuracy of the individual contigs produced from each RAD site sequence suggests RAD-PE sequencing is a useful way to convert genome-wide short reads into individually-assembled sequences hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long.},

Next-generation sequencing technologies are being applied to an increasing number of species with no reference genome. For nonmodel species, the cost, availability of existing genetic resources, genome complexity and the planned method of assembly must all be considered when selecting a sequencing platform. Our goal was to examine the feasibility and optimal methodology for SNP and gene discovery in the sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) using short read sequences. SOLiD short reads (up to 50 bp) were generated from single- and pooled-tissue transcriptome libraries from ten sockeye salmon. The individuals were from five distinct populations from the Wood River Lakes and Mendeltna Creek, Alaska. As no reference genome was available for sockeye salmon, the SOLiD sequence reads were assembled to publicly available EST reference sequences from sockeye salmon and two closely related species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Additionally, de novo assembly of the SOLiD data was carried out, and the SOLiD reads were remapped to the de novo contigs. The results from each reference assembly were compared across all references. The number and size of contigs assembled varied with the size reference sequences. In silico SNP discovery was carried out on contigs from all four EST references; however, discovery of valid SNPs was most successful using one of the two conspecific references.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how organisms interact with their environments is increasingly important for conservation efforts in many species, especially in light of highly anticipated climate changes. One method for understanding this relationship is to use genetic maps and QTL mapping to detect genomic regions linked to phenotypic traits of importance for adaptation. We used high-throughput genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to both detect and map thousands of SNPs in haploid Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We next applied this map to detect QTL related to temperature tolerance and body size in families of diploid Chinook salmon. Using these techniques, we mapped 3534 SNPs in 34 linkage groups which is consistent with the haploid chromosome number for Chinook salmon. We successfully detected three QTL for temperature tolerance and one QTL for body size at the experiment-wide level, as well as additional QTL significant at the chromosome-wide level. The use of haploids coupled with GBS provides a robust pathway to rapidly develop genomic resources in nonmodel organisms; these QTL represent preliminary progress toward linking traits of conservation interest to regions in the Chinook salmon genome.},

Inversions were the first markers used to investigate the genetic structure of natural populations, leading to the concept of coadapted gene complexes and theories concerning founder effects and genetic drift in small populations. However, we still lack elements of a general theory accounting for the origins and distribution of inversions in nature. Here, we use computer simulations to show that a "mixed geographic mode" of evolution involving allopatric separation of populations followed by secondary contact and gene flow generates chromosomal divergence by natural selection under wider conditions than previous hypotheses. This occurs because inversions arising in allopatry contain a full complement of locally adapted genes. Once gene flow ensues, reduced recombination within inversions keeps these favorable genotypic combinations intact, resulting in inverted genomic regions being favored over collinear regions. This process allows inversions to establish to high frequencies. Our model can account for several classic patterns in the geographic distribution of inversions and highlights how selection on standing genetic variation allows rapid chromosomal evolution without the waiting time for new mutations. As inversion differences often separate closely related taxa, mixed modes of divergence could be common.},

  Abstract                 = {To facilitate genome-guided breeding in potato, we developed an 8303 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker array using potato genome and transcriptome resources. To validate the Infinium 8303 Potato Array, we developed linkage maps from two diploid populations (DRH and D84) and compared these maps with the assembled potato genome sequence. Both populations used the doubled monoploid reference genotype DM1-3 516 R44 as the female parent but had different heterozygous diploid male parents (RH89-039-16 and 84SD22). Over 4,400 markers were mapped (1,960 in DRH and 2,454 in D84, 787 in common) resulting in map sizes of 965 (DRH) and 792 (D84) cM, covering 87% (DRH) and 88% (D84) of genome sequence length. Of the mapped markers, 33.5% were in candidate genes selected for the array, 4.5% were markers from existing genetic maps, and 61% were selected based on distribution across the genome. Markers with distorted segregation ratios occurred in blocks in both linkage maps, accounting for 4% (DRH) and 9% (D84) of mapped markers. Markers with distorted segregation ratios were unique to each population with blocks on chromosomes 9 and 12 in DRH and 3, 4, 6 and 8 in D84. Chromosome assignment of markers based on linkage mapping differed from sequence alignment with the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC) pseudomolecules for 1% of the mapped markers with some disconcordant markers attributable to paralogs. In total, 126 (DRH) and 226 (D84) mapped markers were not anchored to the pseudomolecules and provide new scaffold anchoring data to improve the potato genome assembly. The high degree of concordance between the linkage maps and the pseudomolecules demonstrates both the quality of the potato genome sequence and the functionality of the Infinium 8303 Potato Array. The broad genome coverage of the Infinium 8303 Potato Array compared to other marker sets will enable numerous downstream applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Most fish species show little morphological differentiation in the sex chromosomes. We have coupled molecular and cytogenetic analyses to characterize the male-determining region of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Y chromosome. Four genetically diverse male clonal lines of this species were used for genetic and physical mapping of regions in the vicinity of the sex locus. Five markers were genetically mapped to the Y chromosome in these male lines, indicating that the sex locus was located on the same linkage group in each of the lines. We also confirmed the presence of a Y chromosome morphological polymorphism among these lines, with the Y chromosomes from two of the lines having the more common heteromorphic Y chromosome and two of the lines having Y chromosomes morphologically similar to the X chromosome. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) pattern of two probes linked to sex suggested that the sex locus is physically located on the long arm of the Y chromosome. Fishes appear to be an excellent group of organisms for studying sex chromosome evolution and differentiation in vertebrates because they show considerable variability in the mechanisms and (or) patterns involved in sex determination.},

  Abstract                 = {A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology has been determining whether and how gradual, incremental changes at the gene level can account for rapid speciation and bursts of adaptive radiation. Using genome-scale computer simulations, we extend previous theory showing how gradual adaptive change can generate nonlinear population transitions, resulting in the rapid formation of new, reproductively isolated species. We show that these transitions occur via a mechanism rooted in a basic property of biological heredity: the organization of genes in genomes. Genomic organization of genes facilitates two processes: (i) the build-up of statistical associations among large numbers of genes and (ii) the action of divergent selection on persistent combinations of alleles. When a population has accumulated a critical amount of standing, divergently selected variation, the combination of these two processes allows many mutations of small effect to act synergistically and precipitously split one population into two discontinuous, reproductively isolated groups. Periods of allopatry, chromosomal linkage among loci, and large-effect alleles can facilitate this process under some conditions, but are not required for it. Our results complement and extend existing theory on alternative stable states during population divergence, distinct phases of speciation and the rapid emergence of multilocus barriers to gene flow. The results are thus a step towards aligning population genomic theory with modern empirical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

  Abstract                 = {Living at high altitude is one of the most difficult challenges that humans had to cope with during their evolution. Whereas several genomic studies have revealed some of the genetic bases of adaptations in Tibetan, Andean, and Ethiopian populations, relatively little evidence of convergent evolution to altitude in different continents has accumulated. This lack of evidence can be due to truly different evolutionary responses, but it can also be due to the low power of former studies that have mainly focused on populations from a single geographical region or performed separate analyses on multiple pairs of populations to avoid problems linked to shared histories between some populations. We introduce here a hierarchical Bayesian method to detect local adaptation that can deal with complex demographic histories. Our method can identify selection occurring at different scales, as well as convergent adaptation in different regions. We apply our approach to the analysis of a large SNP data set from low- and high-altitude human populations from America and Asia. The simultaneous analysis of these two geographic areas allows us to identify several candidate genome regions for altitudinal selection, and we show that convergent evolution among continents has been quite common. In addition to identifying several genes and biological processes involved in high-altitude adaptation, we identify two specific biological pathways that could have evolved in both continents to counter toxic effects induced by hypoxia.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

  Abstract                 = {Adaptation to local environments often occurs through natural selection acting on a large number of loci, each having a weak phenotypic effect. One way to detect these loci is to identify genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables used as proxies for ecological pressures. Here, we propose new algorithms based on population genetics, ecological modeling, and statistical learning techniques to screen genomes for signatures of local adaptation. Implemented in the computer program "latent factor mixed model" (LFMM), these algorithms employ an approach in which population structure is introduced using unobserved variables. These fast and computationally efficient algorithms detect correlations between environmental and genetic variation while simultaneously inferring background levels of population structure. Comparing these new algorithms with related methods provides evidence that LFMM can efficiently estimate random effects due to population history and isolation-by-distance patterns when computing gene-environment correlations, and decrease the number of false-positive associations in genome scans. We then apply these models to plant and human genetic data, identifying several genes with functions related to development that exhibit strong correlations with climatic gradients.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic map length and gene number in eukaryotes vary considerably less than genome size, giving rise to the hypothesis that recombination is restricted to genes. The complex genome of maize contains a large fraction of repetitive DNA, composed principally of retrotransposons arranged in clusters. Here, we assess directly the contribution of retrotransposon clusters and genes to genetic length. We first measured recombination across adjacent homozygous genetic intervals on either side of the bronze (bz) locus. We then isolated and characterized two bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing those intervals. Recombination was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher in the distal side, which is gene-dense and lacks retrotransposons, than in the proximal side, which is gene-poor and contains a large cluster of methylated retrotransposons. We conclude that the repetitive retrotransposon DNA in maize, which constitutes the bulk of the genome, most likely contributes little if any to genetic length.},

Rather, neutral and adaptive markers provide different types of information that should be combined to make optimal management decisions. Genetic patterns at neutral markers reflect the interaction of gene flow and genetic drift that affects genome-wide variation within and among populations. This population genetic structure is what natural selection operates on to cause adaptive divergence. Here, we provide a new framework to integrate data on neutral and adaptive markers to protect biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {During speciation-with-gene-flow, effective migration varies across the genome as a function of several factors, including proximity of selected loci, recombination rate, strength of selection, and number of selected loci. Genome scans may provide better empirical understanding of the genome-wide patterns of genetic differentiation, especially if the variance due to the previously mentioned factors is partitioned. In North American lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), glacial lineages that diverged in allopatry about 60,000 years ago and came into contact 12,000 years ago have independently evolved in several lakes into two sympatric species pairs (a normal benthic and a dwarf limnetic). Variable degrees of reproductive isolation between species pairs across lakes offer a continuum of genetic and phenotypic divergence associated with adaptation to distinct ecological niches. To disentangle the complex array of genetically based barriers that locally reduce the effective migration rate between whitefish species pairs, we compared genome-wide patterns of divergence across five lakes distributed along this divergence continuum. Using restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we combined genetic mapping and population genetics approaches to identify genomic regions resistant to introgression and derive empirical measures of the barrier strength as a function of recombination distance. We found that the size of the genomic islands of differentiation was influenced by the joint effects of linkage disequilibrium maintained by selection on many loci, the strength of ecological niche divergence, as well as demographic characteristics unique to each lake. Partial parallelism in divergent genomic regions likely reflected the combined effects of polygenic adaptation from standing variation and independent changes in the genetic architecture of postzygotic isolation. This study illustrates how integrating genetic mapping and population genomics of multiple sympatric species pairs provide a window on the speciation-with-gene-flow mechanism.},

RESULTS: We show that the algorithm can assign sample individuals highly accurately to their corresponding ethnic groups in our tests using HapMap SNP data and it is also robust to admixed populations when tested with Perlegen SNP data. Moreover, it can detect fine-scale population structure as subtle as that between Chinese and Japanese by using genome-wide high-diversity SNP loci. CONCLUSION: The algorithm provides an alternative approach to the popular STRUCTURE program, especially for fine-scale population structure detection in genome-wide association studies. This is the first successful separation of Chinese and Japanese samples using random SNP loci with high statistical support.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are cultivated worldwide for aquaculture production and are widely used as a model species to gain knowledge of many aspects of fish biology. The common ancestor of the salmonids experienced a whole genome duplication event, making extant salmonids such as the rainbow trout an excellent model for studying the evolution of tetraploidization and re-diploidization in vertebrates. However, the lack of a reference genome sequence hampers research progress for both academic and applied purposes. In order to enrich the genomic tools already available in this species and provide further insight on the complexity of its genome, we sequenced a large number of rainbow trout BAC-end sequences (BES) and characterized their contents. RESULTS: A total of 176,485 high quality BES, were generated, representing approximately 4% of the trout genome. BES analyses identified 6,848 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), of which 3,854 had high quality flanking sequences for PCR primers design. The first rainbow trout repeat elements database (INRA RT rep1.0) containing 735 putative repeat elements was developed, and identified almost 59.5% of the BES database in base-pairs as repetitive sequence. Approximately 55% of the BES reads (97,846) had more than 100 base pairs of contiguous non-repetitive sequences. The fractions of the 97,846 non-repetitive trout BES reads that had significant BLASTN hits against the zebrafish, medaka and stickleback genome databases were 15%, 16.2% and 17.9%, respectively, while the fractions of the non-repetitive BES reads that had significant BLASTX hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback protein databases were 10.7%, 9.5% and 9.5%, respectively. Comparative genomics using paired BAC-ends revealed several regions of conserved synteny across all the fish species analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of BES provided insights on the rainbow trout genome. The discovery of specific repeat elements will facilitate analyses of sequence content (e.g. for SNPs discovery and for transcriptome characterization) and future genome sequence assemblies. The numerous microsatellites will facilitate integration of the linkage and physical maps and serve as valuable resource for fine mapping QTL and positional cloning of genes affecting aquaculture production traits. Furthermore, comparative genomics through BES can be used for identifying positional candidate genes from QTL mapping studies, aid in future assembly of a reference genome sequence and elucidating sequence content and complexity in the rainbow trout genome.},

Overall, we identified 37 linkage groups (2n = 80) from the analysis of 288 microsatellite polymorphisms, 13 allozyme markers, and phenotypic sex in four backcross families. Additionally, we used gene-centromere analysis to approximate the position of the centromere for 20 linkage groups and thus relate linkage arrangements to the physical morphology of chromosomes. Sex-specific maps derived from multiple parents were estimated to cover 346.4 and 912.5 cM of the male and female genomes, respectively. As previously observed in other salmonids, recombination rates showed large sex differences (average female-to-male ratio was 6.4), with male crossovers generally localized toward the distal end of linkage groups. Putative homeologous regions inherited from the salmonid tetraploid ancestor were identified for 10 pairs of linkage groups, including five chromosomes showing evidence of residual tetrasomy (pseudolinkage). Map alignments with orthologous regions in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and Arctic char also revealed extensive conservation of syntenic blocks across species, which was generally consistent with chromosome divergence through Robertsonian translocations.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Due to a genome duplication event in the recent history of salmonids, modern Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have a mosaic genome with roughly one-third being tetraploid. This is a complicating factor in genotyping and genetic mapping since polymorphisms within duplicated regions (multisite variants; MSVs) are challenging to call and to assign to the correct paralogue. Standard genotyping software offered by Illumina has not been written to interpret MSVs and will either fail or miscall these polymorphisms. For the purpose of mapping, linkage or association studies in non-diploid species, there is a pressing need for software that includes analysis of MSVs in addition to regular single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. RESULTS: A software package is presented for the analysis of partially tetraploid genomes genotyped using Illumina Infinium BeadArrays (Illumina Inc.) that includes pre-processing, clustering, plotting and validation routines. More than 3000 salmon from an aquacultural strain in Norway, distributed among 266 full-sib families, were genotyped on a 15K BeadArray including both SNP- and MSV-markers. A total of 4268 SNPs and 1471 MSVs were identified, with average call accuracies of 0.97 and 0.86, respectively. A total of 150 MSVs polymorphic in both paralogs were dissected and mapped to their respective chromosomes, yielding insights about the salmon genome reversion to diploidy and improving marker genome coverage. Several retained homologies were found and are reported. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R-package beadarrayMSV freely available on the web at http://cran.r-project.org/.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Disentangling the roles of geography and ecology driving population divergence and distinguishing adaptive from neutral evolution at the molecular level have been common goals among evolutionary and conservation biologists. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) multilocus genotypes for 31 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations from the Kvichak River, Alaska, we assessed the relative roles of geography (discrete boundaries or continuous distance) and ecology (spawning habitat and timing) driving genetic divergence in this species at varying spatial scales within the drainage. We also evaluated two outlier detection methods to characterize candidate SNPs responding to environmental selection, emphasizing which mechanism(s) may maintain the genetic variation of outlier loci. RESULTS: For the entire drainage, Mantel tests suggested a greater role of geographic distance on population divergence than differences in spawn timing when each variable was correlated with pairwise genetic distances. Clustering and hierarchical analyses of molecular variance indicated that the largest genetic differentiation occurred between populations from distinct lakes or subdrainages. Within one population-rich lake, however, Mantel tests suggested a greater role of spawn timing than geographic distance on population divergence when each variable was correlated with pairwise genetic distances. Variable spawn timing among populations was linked to specific spawning habitats as revealed by principal coordinate analyses. We additionally identified two outlier SNPs located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II that appeared robust to violations of demographic assumptions from an initial pool of eight candidates for selection. CONCLUSIONS: First, our results suggest that geography and ecology have influenced genetic divergence between Alaskan sockeye salmon populations in a hierarchical manner depending on the spatial scale. Second, we found consistent evidence for diversifying selection in two loci located in the MHC class II by means of outlier detection methods; yet, alternative scenarios for the evolution of these loci were also evaluated. Both conclusions argue that historical contingency and contemporary adaptation have likely driven differentiation between Kvichak River sockeye salmon populations, as revealed by a suite of SNPs. Our findings highlight the need for conservation of complex population structure, because it provides resilience in the face of environmental change, both natural and anthropogenic.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are widely used in genetic association studies. We evaluate the mid p-value, unknown in the genetics literature, as an alternative for the standard p-value in the exact test. METHOD: The type 1 error rate and the power of the exact test are calculated for different sample sizes, significance levels, minor allele counts and degrees of deviation from equilibrium. Three different p-value are considered: the standard two-sided p-value, the doubled one-sided p-value and the mid p-value. Practical implications of using the mid p-value are discussed with HapMap datasets and a data set on colon cancer. RESULTS: The mid p-value is shown to have a type 1 error rate that is always closer to the nominal level, and to have better power. Differences between the standard p-value and the mid p-value can be large for insignificant results, and are smaller for significant results. The analysis of empirical databases shows that the mid p-value uncovers more significant markers, and that the equilibrium null distribution is not tenable for both databases. CONCLUSION: The standard exact p-value is overly conservative, in particular for small minor allele frequencies. The mid p-value ameliorates this problem by bringing the rejection rate closer to the nominal level, at the price of occasionally exceeding the nominal level.},

Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to obtain high-resolution fluorescent DNA fingerprints from individual pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). A dye-labeled primer complementary to the Tcl-like transposon and an unlabeled primer for the Sma1 SINE repeat motif were used to simultaneously amplify between so and 80 fragments ranging in size from 75 to 550 bases using PCR. These fluorescently labeled DNAs were separated on a denaturing acrylamide gel, resolved using an automated DNA sequencing instrument, and analyzed using Genescan and Genotyper software. We found the complex pattern of amplified fragments to be a reliable, specific fingerprint for the individual. Indeed, ''SINE-prints'' have sufficient resolution to discriminate among progeny from different families of single-pair matings of hatchery broodstock. Here we show faithful Mendelian inheritance of these fragments within families of single-pair matings, determine gene-centromere map distances for selected amplified fragments in four families of gynogenetic diploid siblings, and test for linkage among amplified fragments segregating in diploid families, Linkage was found between a small number of fragment pairs, and 37% of the fragments were tightly linked to the centromere. The majority of fragments, however, segregated independently and appear to be dispersed throughout the genome. This DNA fingerprinting technology promises to be a powerful tool with many population and molecular genetic applications for salmonids and other species.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of "standardized allele frequencies" that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools-a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout is an economically important fish and a suitable experimental organism in many fields of biology including genome evolution, owing to the occurrence of a salmonid specific whole-genome duplication (4th WGD). Rainbow trout is among some of the most studied teleosts and has benefited from substantial efforts to develop genomic resources (e.g., linkage maps. Here, we first generated a synthetic map by merging segregation data files derived from three independent linkage maps. Then, we used it to evaluate genome conservation between rainbow trout and three teleost models, medaka, stickleback and zebrafish and to further investigate the extent of the 4th WGD in trout genome. RESULTS: The INRA linkage map was updated by adding 211 new markers. After standardization of marker names, consistency of marker assignment to linkage groups and marker orders was checked across the three different data sets and only loci showing consistent location over all or almost all of the data sets were kept. This resulted in a synthetic map consisting of 2226 markers and 29 linkage groups spanning over 3600 cM. Blastn searches against medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish genomic databases resulted in 778, 824 and 730 significant hits respectively while blastx searches yielded 505, 513 and 510 significant hits. Homology search results revealed that, for most rainbow trout chromosomes, large syntenic regions encompassing nearly whole chromosome arms have been conserved between rainbow trout and its closest models, medaka and stickleback. Large conserved syntenies were also found between the genomes of rainbow trout and the reconstructed teleost ancestor. These syntenies consolidated the known homeologous affinities between rainbow trout chromosomes due to the 4th WGD and suggested new ones. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic map constructed herein further highlights the stability of the teleost genome over long evolutionary time scales. This map can be easily extended by incorporating new data sets and should help future rainbow trout whole genome sequence assembly. Finally, the persistence of large conserved syntenies across teleosts should facilitate the identification of candidate genes through comparative mapping, even if the occurrence of intra-chromosomal micro-rearrangement may hinder the accurate prediction their genomic location.},

  Abstract                 = {Determining the evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of gene duplicates is key to understanding the processes leading to evolutionary adaptation and novelty. In his highly prescient book, Susumu Ohno recognized that duplicate genes are fixed and maintained within a population with 3 distinct outcomes: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and conservation of function. Subsequent researchers have proposed a multitude of population genetic models that lead to these outcomes, each differing largely in the role played by adaptive natural selection. In this paper, I present a nonmathematical review of these models, their predictions, and the evidence collected in support of each of them. Though the various outcomes of gene duplication are often strictly associated with the presence or absence of adaptive natural selection, I argue that determining the outcome of duplication is orthogonal to determining whether natural selection has acted. Despite an ever-growing field of research into the fate of gene duplicates, there is not yet clear evidence for the preponderance of one outcome over the others, much less evidence for the importance of adaptive or nonadaptive forces in maintaining these duplicates.},

Using next-generation sequencing of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) tags, we genotyped thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two wild populations of migratory steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from the Pacific Northwest of the United States. One population maintains a connection to the sea, whereas the other population has been sequestered from its access to the ocean for more than 50 years by a hydropower dam. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to identify 504 RAD SNP markers from several genetic regions that were associated with the propensity to migrate both within and between the populations. Our results corroborate those in previous quantitative trait loci studies and provide evidence for additional loci associated with this complex migratory life history. Our results suggest a complex multi-genic basis with several loci of small effect distributed throughout the genome contributing to migration in this species. We also determined that despite being sequestered for decades, the landlocked population continues to harbour genetic variation associated with a migratory life history and ATPase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of genotyping-by-sequencing and how RAD-tag SNP data can be readily compared between studies to investigate migration within this species.},

  Abstract                 = {The genomic architecture underlying ecological divergence and ecological speciation with gene flow is still largely unknown for most organisms. One central question is whether divergence is genome-wide or localized in 'genomic mosaics' during early stages when gene flow is still pronounced. Empirical work has so far been limited, and the relative impacts of gene flow and natural selection on genomic patterns have not been fully explored. Here, we use ecotypes of Atlantic cod to investigate genomic patterns of diversity and population differentiation in a natural system characterized by high gene flow and large effective population sizes, properties which theoretically could restrict divergence in local genomic regions. We identify a genomic region of strong population differentiation, extending over approximately 20 cM, between pairs of migratory and stationary ecotypes examined at two different localities. Furthermore, the region is characterized by markedly reduced levels of genetic diversity in migratory ecotype samples. The results highlight the genomic region, or 'genomic island', as potentially associated with ecological divergence and suggest the involvement of a selective sweep. Finally, we also confirm earlier findings of localized genomic differentiation in three other linkage groups associated with divergence among eastern Atlantic populations. Thus, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, the results suggest that 'genomic mosaics' of differentiation may even be found under high levels of gene flow and that marine fishes may provide insightful model systems for studying and identifying initial targets of selection during ecological divergence.},

  Abstract                 = {Unlike most anadromous fishes that have evolved strict homing behaviour, Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) seem to lack philopatry as evidenced by minimal population structure across the species range. Yet unexplained findings of within-region population genetic heterogeneity coupled with the morphological and behavioural diversity described for the species suggest that adaptive genetic variation underlying fitness traits may be responsible. We employed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype 4439 quality filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for 518 individuals collected across a broad geographical area including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California. A subset of putatively neutral markers (N = 4068) identified a significant amount of variation among three broad populations: northern British Columbia, Columbia River/southern coast and 'dwarf' adults (F(CT) = 0.02, P << 0.001). Additionally, 162 SNPs were identified as adaptive through outlier tests, and inclusion of these markers revealed a signal of adaptive variation related to geography and life history. The majority of the 162 adaptive SNPs were not independent and formed four groups of linked loci. Analyses with matsam software found that 42 of these outlier SNPs were significantly associated with geography, run timing and dwarf life history, and 27 of these 42 SNPs aligned with known genes or highly conserved genomic regions using the genome browser available for sea lamprey. This study provides both neutral and adaptive context for observed genetic divergence among collections and thus reconciles previous findings of population genetic heterogeneity within a species that displays extensive gene flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome duplications (WGDs) have been hypothesized to be responsible for major transitions in evolution. However, the effects of WGD and subsequent gene loss on cellular behavior and metabolism are still poorly understood. Here we develop a genome scale evolutionary model to study the dynamics of gene loss and metabolic adaptation after WGD. Using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example, we primarily study the outcome of WGD on yeast as it currently is. However, similar results were obtained using a recontructed hypothetical metabolic network of the pre-WGD ancestor. We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral WGD in S. cerevisiae. Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after WGD and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after WGD. Furthermore, the model shows that WGD leads to better adaptation than small-scale duplications, in environments for which duplication of a whole pathway instead of single reactions is needed to increase fitness. This is indeed the case for adaptation to high glucose levels. Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that WGD has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. Moreover, the model shows that WGD is almost always detrimental on the short term in environments to which the lineage is preadapted, but can have immediate fitness benefits in "new" environments. This explains why WGD, while pivotal in the evolution of many lineages and an apparent "easy" genetic operator, occurs relatively rarely.},

  Abstract                 = {The increased numbers of genetic markers produced by genomic techniques have the potential to both identify hybrid individuals and localize chromosomal regions responding to selection and contributing to introgression. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to identify a dense set of candidate SNP loci with fixed allelic differences between introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi). We distinguished candidate SNPs from homeologs (paralogs resulting from whole-genome duplication) by detecting excessively high observed heterozygosity and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We identified 2923 candidate species-specific SNPs from a single Illumina sequencing lane containing 24 barcode-labelled individuals. Published sequence data and ongoing genome sequencing of rainbow trout will allow physical mapping of SNP loci for genome-wide scans and will also provide flanking sequence for design of qPCR-based TaqMan((R)) assays for high-throughput, low-cost hybrid identification using a subset of 50-100 loci. This study demonstrates that it is now feasible to identify thousands of informative SNPs in nonmodel species quickly and at reasonable cost, even if no prior genomic information is available.},

  Abstract                 = {Population genomic studies are beginning to provide a more comprehensive view of dynamic genome-scale processes in evolution. Patterns of genomic architecture, such as genomic islands of increased divergence, may be important for adaptive population differentiation and speciation. We used next-generation sequencing data to examine the patterns of local and long-distance linkage disequilibrium (LD) across oceanic and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback, a useful model for studies of evolution and speciation. We looked for associations between LD and signatures of divergent selection, and assessed the role of recombination rate variation in generating LD patterns. As predicted under the traditional biogeographic model of unidirectional gene flow from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater stickleback populations, we found extensive local and long-distance LD in fresh water. Surprisingly, oceanic populations showed similar patterns of elevated LD, notably between large genomic regions previously implicated in adaptation to fresh water. These results support an alternative biogeographic model for the stickleback radiation, one of a metapopulation with appreciable bi-directional gene flow combined with strong divergent selection between oceanic and freshwater populations. As predicted by theory, these processes can maintain LD within and among genomic islands of divergence. These findings suggest that the genomic architecture in oceanic stickleback populations may provide a mechanism for the rapid re-assembly and evolution of multi-locus genotypes in newly colonized freshwater habitats, and may help explain genetic mapping of parallel phenotypic variation to similar loci across independent freshwater populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing technology provides novel opportunities for gathering genome-scale sequence data in natural populations, laying the empirical foundation for the evolving field of population genomics. Here we conducted a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations. Overall estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations confirm the biogeographic hypothesis that large panmictic oceanic populations have repeatedly given rise to phenotypically divergent freshwater populations. Genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both balancing and divergent selection were remarkably consistent across multiple, independently derived populations, indicating that replicate parallel phenotypic evolution in stickleback may be occurring through extensive, parallel genetic evolution at a genome-wide scale. Some of these genomic regions co-localize with previously identified QTL for stickleback phenotypic variation identified using laboratory mapping crosses. In addition, we have identified several novel regions showing parallel differentiation across independent populations. Annotation of these regions revealed numerous genes that are candidates for stickleback phenotypic evolution and will form the basis of future genetic analyses in this and other organisms. This study represents the first high-density SNP-based genome scan of genetic diversity and differentiation for populations of threespine stickleback in the wild. These data illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory crosses and population genomic scans by confirming the adaptive significance of previously identified genomic regions, elucidating the particular evolutionary and demographic history of such regions in natural populations, and identifying new genomic regions and candidate genes of evolutionary significance.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid and inexpensive methods for genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping are urgently needed for population management and conservation. In hybridized populations, genomic techniques that can identify and genotype thousands of species-diagnostic markers would allow precise estimates of population- and individual-level admixture as well as identification of 'super invasive' alleles, which show elevated rates of introgression above the genomewide background (likely due to natural selection). Techniques like restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing can discover and genotype large numbers of SNPs, but they have been limited by the length of continuous sequence data they produce with Illumina short-read sequencing. We present a novel approach, overlapping paired-end RAD sequencing, to generate RAD contigs of >300-400 bp. These contigs provide sufficient flanking sequence for design of high-throughput SNP genotyping arrays and strict filtering to identify duplicate paralogous loci. We applied this approach in five populations of native westslope cutthroat trout that previously showed varying (low) levels of admixture from introduced rainbow trout (RBT). We produced 77 141 RAD contigs and used these data to filter and genotype 3180 previously identified species-diagnostic SNP loci. Our population-level and individual-level estimates of admixture were generally consistent with previous microsatellite-based estimates from the same individuals. However, we observed slightly lower admixture estimates from genomewide markers, which might result from natural selection against certain genome regions, different genomic locations for microsatellites vs. RAD-derived SNPs and/or sampling error from the small number of microsatellite loci (n = 7). We also identified candidate adaptive super invasive alleles from RBT that had excessively high admixture proportions in hybridized cutthroat trout populations.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the third generation of the CAP sequence assembly program. The CAP3 program includes a number of improvements and new features. The program has a capability to clip 5' and 3' low-quality regions of reads. It uses base quality values in computation of overlaps between reads, construction of multiple sequence alignments of reads, and generation of consensus sequences. The program also uses forward-reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link contigs. Results of CAP3 on four BAC data sets are presented. The performance of CAP3 was compared with that of PHRAP on a number of BAC data sets. PHRAP often produces longer contigs than CAP3 whereas CAP3 often produces fewer errors in consensus sequences than PHRAP. It is easier to construct scaffolds with CAP3 than with PHRAP on low-pass data with forward-reverse constraints.},

However, recent analyses of ancient WGDs in yeast and vertebrates have not shown any evidence for increased rearrangement after WGD. When WGD events across all three kingdoms of eukaryotic life are considered-including plants, yeast, vertebrates, and human cancers-we find that a variety of outcomes are possible, from genome restructuring to genome stasis. In fact, striking differences in genome change after WGD can be observed within single plant genera, indicating that there are no simple rules that can predict a genome's reaction to WGD.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans have had a significant impact on the distribution and abundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through its widespread use in beer, bread and wine production. Yet, similar to other Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae has also been isolated from habitats unrelated to fermentations. Strains of S. cerevisiae isolated from grapes, wine must and vineyards worldwide are genetically differentiated from strains isolated from oak-tree bark, exudate and associated soil in North America. However, the causes and consequences of this differentiation have not yet been resolved. Historical differentiation of these two groups may have been influenced by geographic, ecological or human-associated barriers to gene flow. Here, we make use of the relatively recent establishment of vineyards across North America to identify and characterize any active barriers to gene flow between these two groups. We examined S. cerevisiae strains isolated from grapes and oak trees within three North American vineyards and compared them to those isolated from oak trees outside of vineyards. Within vineyards, we found evidence of migration between grapes and oak trees and potential gene flow between the divergent oak-tree and vineyard groups. Yet, we found no vineyard genotypes on oak trees outside of vineyards. In contrast, Saccharomyces paradoxus isolated from the same sources showed population structure characterized by isolation by distance. The apparent absence of ecological or genetic barriers between sympatric vineyard and oak-tree populations of S. cerevisiae implies that vineyards play an important role in the mixing between these two groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Canadian salmon are now eligible for protection under a federal Species at Risk Act proclaimed in June 2003 and fully implemented in June 2004. The act has four major steps dealing with species at risk of extinction: (1) an independent scientific committee assesses biological status and designates those at risk, (2) Federal Cabinet decides, following consideration of socioeconomic implications, which species to add to the legal list of species at risk, (3) legal protection, and (4) recovery planning and implementation. The committee has designated five distinct populations of salmon as endangered-one Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), one coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), two sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and one Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha). Only the Atlantic salmon is currently listed under the act; Cabinet decided not to list the two sockeye after considering socioeconomic implications and decisions on listing coho and Chinook are pending socioeconomic assessment. Both the Species at Risk Act in Canada and the Endangered Species Act in the United States use multiple criteria to assess the status of units that may be below the taxonomic species level. The Canadian act, in contrast to the act in the United States, mandates a non-governmental committee to assess status, separates biology from socioeconomics in the listing process, does not consider socioeconomic consequences when identifying critical habitat, and has specific timetables for the completion of recovery plans. Canadian salmon managers must now consider the effects of fisheries on salmon diversity, resulting in changes to the way fisheries are managed. The enactment of the act has introduced a new process for protecting salmon diversity in Canada, and its continued development and application will provide an interesting contrast to salmon conservation efforts in the United States.},

Statistical analyses identified four major genetic assemblages of sockeye salmon in the 1924 samples. Two of these putative historical groupings were found to be genetically similar to extant evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) in the Okanogan and Wenatchee Rivers (pairwise F(ST) = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively), and assignment tests were able to allocate 77% of the fish in these two historical groupings to the contemporary Okanogan River and Lake Wenatchee ESUs. A third historical genetic grouping was most closely aligned with contemporary sockeye salmon in Redfish Lake, Idaho, although the association was less robust (pairwise F(ST) = 0.060). However, a fourth genetic grouping did not appear to be related to any contemporary sockeye salmon or kokanee population, assigned poorly to the O. nerka baseline, and had distinctive early return migration timing, suggesting that this group represents a historical ESU originating in headwater lakes in British Columbia that was probably extirpated sometime after 1924. The lack of a contemporary O. nerka population possessing the genetic legacy of this extinct ESU indicates that efforts to reestablish early-migrating sockeye salmon to the headwater lakes region of the Columbia River will be difficult.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a culturally-informed understanding of the impacts of climate change on a highly important subsistence activity that has been practiced by First Nations of central British Columbia for thousands of years. The paper begins with a review of the science regarding sockeye salmon and climate change. It discusses harvest patterns, and how the timing of runs has changed. A survey was conducted by the first author regarding St'at'imc traditional fishing at a historic site on the Fraser River, in 2005. The results show that the impacts of climate change are apparent to those conducting traditional fishing practices, in terms of changed timing and abundance of salmon runs. These perceptions fit closely with the information available from scientists and management agencies. These changes are highly problematic for the St'at'imc, in that the preservation method (drying) is tied to seasonal weather patterns. The whole cultural setting, and the relevance of salmon for subsistence would be highly altered by climate change that leads to changes in the timing and abundance of sockeye salmon. The paper discusses mitigation and adaptation alternatives, but also indicates the scope of these seem limited, given the resource systems and the context of these activities.},

Here, we report a draft genome sequence with long-range linkage and substantial anchoring to the 21 Tetraodon chromosomes. Genome analysis provides a greatly improved fish gene catalogue, including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in fish. Comparison with other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that fish proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues. Comparison with the human genome suggests approximately 900 previously unannotated human genes. Analysis of the Tetraodon and human genomes shows that whole-genome duplication occurred in the teleost fish lineage, subsequent to its divergence from mammals. The analysis also makes it possible to infer the basic structure of the ancestral bony vertebrate genome, which was composed of 12 chromosomes, and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent chromosome rearrangements leading to the modern human karyotype.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of genes and genomes after polyploidization has been the subject of extensive studies in evolutionary biology and plant sciences. While a significant number of duplicated genes are rapidly removed during a process called fractionation, which operates after the whole-genome duplication (WGD), another considerable number of genes are retained preferentially, leading to the phenomenon of biased gene retention. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying gene retention after WGD remain largely unknown. Through genome-wide analyses of sequence and functional data, we comprehensively investigated the relationships between gene features and the retention probability of duplicated genes after WGDs in six plant genomes, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), soybean (Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays). The results showed that multiple gene features were correlated with the probability of gene retention. Using a logistic regression model based on principal component analysis, we resolved evolutionary rate, structural complexity, and GC3 content as the three major contributors to gene retention. Cluster analysis of these features further classified retained genes into three distinct groups in terms of gene features and evolutionary behaviors. Type I genes are more prone to be selected by dosage balance; type II genes are possibly subject to subfunctionalization; and type III genes may serve as potential targets for neofunctionalization. This study highlights that gene features are able to act jointly as primary forces when determining the retention and evolution of WGD-derived duplicated genes in flowering plants. These findings thus may help to provide a resolution to the debate on different evolutionary models of gene fates after WGDs.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Although it is agreed that a major polyploidy event, gamma, occurred within the eudicots, the phylogenetic placement of the event remains unclear. RESULTS: To determine when this polyploidization occurred relative to speciation events in angiosperm history, we employed a phylogenomic approach to investigate the timing of gene set duplications located on syntenic gamma blocks. We populated 769 putative gene families with large sets of homologs obtained from public transcriptomes of basal angiosperms, magnoliids, asterids, and more than 91.8 gigabases of new next-generation transcriptome sequences of non-grass monocots and basal eudicots. The overwhelming majority (95%) of well-resolved gamma duplications was placed before the separation of rosids and asterids and after the split of monocots and eudicots, providing strong evidence that the gamma polyploidy event occurred early in eudicot evolution. Further, the majority of gene duplications was placed after the divergence of the Ranunculales and core eudicots, indicating that the gamma appears to be restricted to core eudicots. Molecular dating estimates indicate that the duplication events were intensely concentrated around 117 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid radiation of core eudicot lineages that gave rise to nearly 75% of angiosperm species appears to have occurred coincidentally or shortly following the gamma triplication event. Reconciliation of gene trees with a species phylogeny can elucidate the timing of major events in genome evolution, even when genome sequences are only available for a subset of species represented in the gene trees. Comprehensive transcriptome datasets are valuable complements to genome sequences for high-resolution phylogenomic analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, followed by gene loss and diploidization has long been recognized as an important evolutionary force in animals, fungi and other organisms, especially plants. The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications, but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications-one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms.},

  Abstract                 = {Delaying sexual maturation can lead to larger body size and higher reproductive success, but carries an increased risk of death before reproducing. Classical life history theory predicts that trade-offs between reproductive success and survival should lead to the evolution of an optimal strategy in a given population. However, variation in mating strategies generally persists, and in general, there remains a poor understanding of genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying this variation. One extreme case of this is in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which can show variation in the age at which they return from their marine migration to spawn (i.e. their 'sea age'). This results in large size differences between strategies, with direct implications for individual fitness. Here, we used an Illumina Infinium SNP array to identify regions of the genome associated with variation in sea age in a large population of Atlantic salmon in Northern Europe, implementing individual-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population-based FST outlier analyses. We identified several regions of the genome which vary in association with phenotype and/or selection between sea ages, with nearby genes having functions related to muscle development, metabolism, immune response and mate choice. In addition, we found that individuals of different sea ages belong to different, yet sympatric populations in this system, indicating that reproductive isolation may be driven by divergence between stable strategies. Overall, this study demonstrates how genome-wide methodologies can be integrated with samples collected from wild, structured populations to understand their ecology and evolution in a natural context.},

Many scientists have used the computer program CERVUS to estimate parentage, and have taken advantage of its option to allow for genotyping error. In this study, we show that the likelihood equations used by versions 1.0 and 2.0 of CERVUS to accommodate genotyping error miscalculate the probability of observing an erroneous genotype. Computer simulation and reanalysis of paternity in Rum red deer show that correcting this error increases success in paternity assignment, and that there is a clear benefit to accommodating genotyping errors when errors are present. A new version of CERVUS (3.0) implementing the corrected likelihood equations is available at http://www.fieldgenetics.com.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive radiations are an important source of biodiversity and are often characterized by many speciation events in very short succession. It has been proposed that the high speciation rates in these radiations may be fuelled by novel genetic combinations produced in episodes of hybridization among the young species. The role of such hybridization events in the evolutionary history of a group can be investigated by comparing the genealogical relationships inferred from different subsets of loci, but such studies have thus far often been hampered by shallow genetic divergences, especially in young adaptive radiations, and the lack of genome-scale molecular data. Here, we use a genome-wide sampling of SNPs identified within restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) tags to investigate the genomic consistency of patterns of shared ancestry and adaptive divergence among five sympatric cichlid species of two genera, Pundamilia and Mbipia, which form part of the massive adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Lake Victoria. Species pairs differ along several axes: male nuptial colouration, feeding ecology, depth distribution, as well as the morphological traits that distinguish the two genera and more subtle morphological differences. Using outlier scan approaches, we identify signals of divergent selection between all species pairs with a number of loci showing parallel patterns in replicated contrasts either between genera or between male colour types. We then create SNP subsets that we expect to be characterized to different extents by selection history and neutral processes and describe phylogenetic and population genetic patterns across these subsets. These analyses reveal very different evolutionary histories for different regions of the genome. To explain these results, we propose at least two intergeneric hybridization events (between Mbipia spp. and Pundamilia spp.) in the evolutionary history of these five species that would have lead to the evolution of novel trait combinations and new species.},

  Abstract                 = {It is generally accepted that the wide variation in genome size observed among eukaryotic species is more closely correlated with the amount of repetitive DNA than with the number of coding genes. Major types of repetitive DNA include transposable elements, satellite DNAs, simple sequences and tandem repeats, but reliable estimates of the relative contributions of these various types to total genome size have been hard to obtain. With the advent of genome sequencing, such information is starting to become available, but no firm conclusions can yet be made from the limited data currently available. Here, the ways in which transposable elements contribute both directly and indirectly to genome size variation are explored. Limited evidence is provided to support the existence of an approximately linear relationship between total transposable element DNA and genome size. Copy numbers per family are low and globally constrained in small genomes, but vary widely in large genomes. Thus, the partial release of transposable element copy number constraints appears to be a major characteristic of large genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome duplication has been implicated in evolutionary innovation and rapid diversification. In salmonid fishes, however, whole genome duplication significantly pre-dates major transitions across the family, and re-diploidization has been a gradual process between genomes that have remained essentially collinear. Nevertheless, pairs of duplicated chromosome arms have diverged at different rates from each other, suggesting that the retention of duplicated regions through occasional pairing between homeologous chromosomes may have played an evolutionary role across species pairs. Extensive chromosomal arm rearrangements have been a key mechanism involved in re-dipliodization of the salmonid genome; therefore, we investigated their influence on degree of differentiation between homeologs across salmon species. We derived a linkage map for coho salmon and performed comparative mapping across syntenic arms within the genus Oncorhynchus, and with the genus Salmo, to determine the phylogenetic relationship between chromosome arrangements and the retention of undifferentiated duplicated regions. A 6596.7 cM female coho salmon map, comprising 30 linkage groups with 7415 and 1266 nonduplicated and duplicated loci, respectively, revealed uneven distribution of duplicated loci along and between chromosome arms. These duplicated regions were conserved across syntenic arms across Oncorhynchus species and were identified in metacentric chromosomes likely formed ancestrally to the divergence of Oncorhynchus from Salmo. These findings support previous studies in which observed pairings involved at least one metacentric chromosome. Re-diploidization in salmon may have been prevented or retarded by the formation of metacentric chromosomes after the whole genome duplication event and may explain lineage-specific innovations in salmon species if functional genes are found in these regions.},

  Abstract                 = {A subject of extensive study in evolutionary theory has been the issue of how neutral, redundant copies can be maintained in the genome for long periods of time. Concurrently, examples of adaptive gene duplications to various environmental conditions in different species have been described. At this point, it is too early to tell whether or not a substantial fraction of gene copies have initially achieved fixation by positive selection for increased dosage. Nevertheless, enough examples have accumulated in the literature that such a possibility should be considered. Here, I review the recent examples of adaptive gene duplications and make an attempt to draw generalizations on what types of genes may be particularly prone to be selected for under certain environmental conditions. The identification of copy-number variation in ecological field studies of species adapting to stressful or novel environmental conditions may improve our understanding of gene duplications as a mechanism of adaptation and its relevance to the long-term persistence of gene duplications.},

  Abstract                 = {Tetraploid hybrid tea roses (Rosa hybrida) represent most of the commercial cultivars of cut roses and form the basis for breeding programmes. Due to intensive interspecific hybridizations, modern cut roses are complex tetraploids for which the mode of inheritance is not exactly known. The segregation patterns of molecular markers in a tetraploid mapping population of 184 genotypes, an F(1) progeny from a cross of two heterozygous parents, were investigated for disomic and tetrasomic inheritance. The possible occurrence of double reduction was studied as well. We can exclude disomic inheritance, but while our observations are more in line with a tetrasomic inheritance, we cannot exclude that there is a mixture of both inheritance modes. Two novel parental tetraploid linkage maps were constructed using markers known from literature, combined with newly generated markers. Comparison with the integrated consensus diploid map (ICM) of Spiller et al. (Theor Appl Genet 122:489-500, 2010) allowed assigning numbers to each of the linkage groups of both maps and including small linkage groups. So far, the possibility of using marker-assisted selection in breeding of tetraploid cut roses and of other species with a tetrasomic or partly tetrasomic inheritance, is still limited due to the difficulties in establishing marker-trait associations. We used these tetraploid linkage maps to determine associations between markers, two morphological traits and powdery mildew resistance. The knowledge on inheritance and marker-trait associations in tetraploid cut roses will be of direct use to cut rose breeding.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Salmonids are of interest because of their relatively recent genome duplication, and their extensive use in wild fisheries and aquaculture. A comprehensive gene list and a comparison of genes in some of the different species provide valuable genomic information for one of the most widely studied groups of fish. RESULTS: 298,304 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Atlantic salmon (69% of the total), 11,664 chinook, 10,813 sockeye, 10,051 brook trout, 10,975 grayling, 8,630 lake whitefish, and 3,624 northern pike ESTs were obtained in this study and have been deposited into the public databases. Contigs were built and putative full-length Atlantic salmon clones have been identified. A database containing ESTs, assemblies, consensus sequences, open reading frames, gene predictions and putative annotation is available. The overall similarity between Atlantic salmon ESTs and those of rainbow trout, chinook, sockeye, brook trout, grayling, lake whitefish, northern pike and rainbow smelt is 93.4, 94.2, 94.6, 94.4, 92.5, 91.7, 89.6, and 86.2% respectively. An analysis of 78 transcript sets show Salmo as a sister group to Oncorhynchus and Salvelinus within Salmoninae, and Thymallinae as a sister group to Salmoninae and Coregoninae within Salmonidae. Extensive gene duplication is consistent with a genome duplication in the common ancestor of salmonids. Using all of the available EST data, a new expanded salmonid cDNA microarray of 32,000 features was created. Cross-species hybridizations to this cDNA microarray indicate that this resource will be useful for studies of all 68 salmonid species. CONCLUSION: An extensive collection and analysis of salmonid RNA putative transcripts indicate that Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon and charr are 94-96% similar while the more distant whitefish, grayling, pike and smelt are 93, 92, 89 and 86% similar to salmon. The salmonid transcriptome reveals a complex history of gene duplication that is consistent with an ancestral salmonid genome duplication hypothesis. Genome resources, including a new 32 K microarray, provide valuable new tools to study salmonids.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene expression divergence and chromosomal rearrangements have been put forward as major contributors to phenotypic differences between closely related species. It has also been established that duplicated genes show enhanced rates of positive selection in their amino acid sequences. If functional divergence is largely due to changes in gene expression, it follows that regulatory sequences in duplicated loci should also evolve rapidly. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) on all noncoding loci within 5 kb of every transcript in the human genome and identified sequences with increased substitution rates in the human lineage since divergence from Old World Monkeys. The fraction of rapidly evolving loci is significantly higher nearby genes that duplicated in the common ancestor of humans and chimps compared with nonduplicated genes. We also conducted a genome-wide scan for nucleotide substitutions predicted to affect transcription factor binding. Rates of binding site divergence are elevated in noncoding sequences of duplicated loci with accelerated substitution rates. Many of the genes associated with these fast-evolving genomic elements belong to functional categories identified in previous studies of positive selection on amino acid sequences. In addition, we find enrichment for accelerated evolution nearby genes involved in establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, processes that differ significantly between humans and monkeys. Our findings support the hypothesis that adaptive evolution of the regulation of duplicated genes has played a significant role in human evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of captive broodstocks is becoming more frequently employed as the number of species facing endangerment or extinction throughout the world increases. Efforts to rebuild the endangered Snake River sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, population have been ongoing for over a decade, but the use of microsatellite data to develop inbreeding avoidance matrices is a more recent component to the program. This study used known genealogical relationships among sockeye salmon offspring to test four different pairwise relatedness estimators and a maximum-likelihood (M-L) relatedness estimator. The goal of this study was to develop a breeding strategy with these estimators that would minimize the loss of genetic diversity, minimize inbreeding, and determine how returning anadromous adults are incorporated into the broodstock along with full-term hatchery adults. Results of this study indicated that both the M (xy) and R (QG) estimators had the lowest Type II error rates and the M-L and R (R) estimators had the lowest Type I error rates. An approach that utilizes a combination of estimators may provide the most valuable information for managers. We recommend that the M-L and R (R) methods be used to rank the genetic importance of returning adults and the M (xy) or R (QG) estimators be used to determine which fish to pair for spawning. This approach provides for the best genetic management of this captive, endangered population and should be generally applicable to the genetic management of other endangered stocks with no pedigree.},

In these fish, experimental immersion challenges with U isolates cause extremely high mortality and M isolates cause low or no mortality. When survivors of M virus immersion challenges were exposed to a secondary challenge with virulent U type virus they experienced high mortality, indicating that the primary M challenge did not elicit protective immunity. Delivery of a moderate dose (2 x 10(4) plaque-forming units [PFU]/fish) of virus by intraperitoneal injection challenge did not overcome RFL sockeye salmon resistance to M type IHNV. Injection challenge with a high dose (5 X 10(6) PFU/fish) of M type virus caused 10% mortality, and in this case survivors did develop protective immunity against a secondary U type virus challenge. Thus, although it is possible for M type IHNV to elicit cross-protective immunity in this disease model, it does not develop after immersion challenge despite entry, transient replication of M virus to low levels, stimulation of innate immune genes, and development of neutralizing antibodies in some fish.},

  Abstract                 = {The high commercial value from the aquaculture of salmonid fishes has prompted many studies into the genetic architecture of complex traits and the need to identify genomic regions that have repeatable associations with trait variation both within and among species. We searched for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for body weight (BW), condition factor (CF) and age of sexual maturation (MAT) in families of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) from an Icelandic breeding program. QTL with genome-wide significance were detected for each trait on multiple Arctic charr (AC) linkage groups (BW: AC-4, AC-20; CF: AC-7, AC-20, AC-23, AC-36; MAT: AC-13/34, AC-39). In addition to the genome-wide significant QTL for both BW and CF on AC-20, linkage groups AC-4, AC-7, AC-8, and AC-16 contain QTL for both BW and CF with chromosome-wide significance. These regions had effects (albeit weaker) on MAT with the exception of the region on AC-8. Comparisons with a North American cultured strain of Arctic charr, as well as North American populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), reveal some conservation in QTL location and structure, particularly with respect to the joint associations of QTL influencing BW and CF. The detection of some differences in genetic architecture between the two aquaculture strains of Arctic charr may be reflective of the differential evolutionary histories experienced by these fishes, and illustrates the importance of including different strains to investigate genetic variation in a species where the intent is to use that variation in selective breeding programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Having diverged 50 MYA, rice remained diploid while the maize lineage became tetraploid and then fractionated by losing genes from one or the other duplicate region. We sequenced and annotated 13 maize genes (counting the duplicate gene as one gene) on one or the other of the pair of homeologous maize regions; 12 genes were present in one cluster in rice. Excellent maize-rice synteny was evident, but only after the fractionated maize regions were condensed onto a finished rice map. Excluding the gene we used to define homeologs, we found zero retention. Once retained, fractionation (loss of functioning DNA sequence) could occur within cis-acting gene space. We chose a retained duplicate basic leucine zipper transcription factor gene because it was well marked with big, exact phylogenetic footprints (CNSs). Detailed alignments of lg2 and retained duplicate lrs1 to their rice ortholog found that fractionation of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) was rare, as expected. Of 30 CNSs, 27 were conserved. The 3 unexpected, missing CNSs and a large insertion support subfunctionalization as a reflection of fractionation of cis-acting gene space and the recent evolution of lg2's novel maize leaf and shoot developmental functions. In general, the principles of fractionation and consolidation work well in making sense of maize gene and genomic sequence data.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in population genomics have made it possible to detect previously unidentified structure, obtain more accurate estimates of demographic parameters, and explore adaptive divergence, potentially revolutionizing the way genetic data are used to manage wild populations. Here, we identified 10 944 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to explore population structure, demography, and adaptive divergence in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from western Alaska. Patterns of population structure were similar to those of past studies, but our ability to assign individuals back to their region of origin was greatly improved (>90% accuracy for all populations). We also calculated effective size with and without removing physically linked loci identified from a linkage map, a novel method for nonmodel organisms. Estimates of effective size were generally above 1000 and were biased downward when physically linked loci were not removed. Outlier tests based on genetic differentiation identified 733 loci and three genomic regions under putative selection. These markers and genomic regions are excellent candidates for future research and can be used to create high-resolution panels for genetic monitoring and population assignment. This work demonstrates the utility of genomic data to inform conservation in highly exploited species with shallow population structure.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the ability to adapt to seawater in teleost fish is modulated by genetic factors. Most studies have involved the comparison of species or strains and little is known about the genetic architecture of the trait. To address this question, we searched for QTL affecting osmoregulation capacities after transfer to saline water in a nonmigratory captive-bred population of rainbow trout. RESULTS: A QTL design (5 full-sib families, about 200 F2 progeny each) was produced from a cross between F0 grand-parents previously selected during two generations for a high or a low cortisol response after a standardized confinement stress. When fish were about 18 months old (near 204 g body weight), individual progeny were submitted to two successive hyper-osmotic challenges (30 ppt salinity) 14 days apart. Plasma chloride and sodium concentrations were recorded 24 h after each transfer. After the second challenge, fish were sacrificed and a gill index (weight of total gill arches corrected for body weight) was recorded. The genome scan was performed with 196 microsatellites and 85 SNP markers. Unitrait and multiple-trait QTL analyses were carried out on the whole dataset (5 families) through interval mapping methods with the QTLMap software. For post-challenge plasma ion concentrations, significant QTL (P < 0.05) were found on six different linkage groups and highly suggestive ones (P < 0.10) on two additional linkage groups. Most QTL affected concentrations of both chloride and sodium during both challenges, but some were specific to either chloride (2 QTL) or sodium (1 QTL) concentrations. Six QTL (4 significant, 2 suggestive) affecting gill index were discovered. Two were specific to the trait, while the others were also identified as QTL for post-challenge ion concentrations. Altogether, allelic effects were consistent for QTL affecting chloride and sodium concentrations but inconsistent for QTL affecting ion concentrations and gill morphology. There was no systematic lineage effect (grand-parental origin of QTL alleles) on the recorded traits. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, genomic loci associated with effects on major physiological components of osmotic adaptation to seawater in a nonmigratory fish were revealed. The results pave the way for further deciphering of the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying seawater adaptation and genes involved in osmoregulatory physiology in rainbow trout and other euryhaline fishes.},

  Abstract                 = {The availability of reliable genetic linkage maps is crucial for functional and evolutionary genomic analyses. Established theory and methods of genetic linkage analysis have made map construction a routine exercise in diploids. However, many evolutionarily, ecologically, and/or agronomically important species are autopolyploids, with autotetraploidy being a typical example. These species undergo much more complicated chromosomal segregation and recombination at meiosis than diploids. In addition, there is evidence of polyploidy-induced and highly dynamic changes in the structure of the genome. These polysomic characteristics indicate the inappropriateness of the theory and methods of linkage analysis in diploids for use in these species and a gap in the theory and methodology of tetraploid map construction. This paper presents a theoretical model and statistical framework for multilocus linkage analysis in autotetraploids for use with dominant and/or codominant DNA molecular markers. The theory and methods incorporate the essential features of allele segregation and recombination under tetrasomic inheritance and the major challenges in statistical modeling and marker data analysis. We validated the method and explored its statistical properties by intensive simulation study and demonstrated its utility by analysis of AFLP and SSR marker data from an outbred autotetraploid potato population.},

  Abstract                 = {Family samples, which can be enriched for rare causal variants by focusing on families with multiple extreme individuals and which facilitate detection of de novo mutation events, provide an attractive resource for next-generation sequencing studies. Here, we describe, implement, and evaluate a likelihood-based framework for analysis of next generation sequence data in family samples. Our framework is able to identify variant sites accurately and to assign individual genotypes, and can handle de novo mutation events, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of variant calling and de novo mutation detection. Through simulations we show explicit modeling of family relationships is especially useful for analyses of low-frequency variants and that genotype accuracy increases with the number of individuals sequenced per family. Compared with the standard approach of ignoring relatedness, our methods identify and accurately genotype more variants, and have high specificity for detecting de novo mutation events. The improvement in accuracy using our methods over the standard approach is particularly pronounced for low-frequency variants. Furthermore the family-aware calling framework dramatically reduces Mendelian inconsistencies and is beneficial for family-based analysis. We hope our framework and software will facilitate continuing efforts to identify genetic factors underlying human diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) has been described as the hoof and mouth disease of salmon farming. ISA is caused by a lethal and highly communicable virus, which can have a major impact on salmon aquaculture, as demonstrated by an outbreak in Chile in 2007. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ISA resistance has been mapped to three microsatellite markers on linkage group (LG) 8 (Chr 15) on the Atlantic salmon genetic map. We identified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and three fingerprint contigs from the Atlantic salmon physical map that contains these markers. We made use of the extensive BAC end sequence database to extend these contigs by chromosome walking and identified additional two markers in this region. The BAC end sequences were used to search for conserved synteny between this segment of LG8 and the fish genomes that have been sequenced. An examination of the genes in the syntenic segments of the tetraodon and medaka genomes identified candidates for association with ISA resistance in Atlantic salmon based on differential expression profiles from ISA challenges or on the putative biological functions of the proteins they encode. One gene in particular, HIV-EP2/MBP-2, caught our attention as it may influence the expression of several genes that have been implicated in the response to infection by infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). Therefore, we suggest that HIV-EP2/MBP-2 is a very strong candidate for the gene associated with the ISAV resistance QTL in Atlantic salmon and is worthy of further study.},

In brown trout (Salmo trutta) the sex-determining locus, SEX, has been mapped to the end of linkage group BT-28, which corresponds to linkage group AS-8 and chromosome SSA15 in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We set out to identify the sex chromosomes in brown trout. We isolated Atlantic salmon BAC clones containing microsatellite markers that are on BT-28 and also on AS-8, and used these BACs as probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. SEX is located on the short arm of a small subtelocentric/acrocentric chromosome in brown trout, which is consistent with linkage analysis. The acrocentric chromosome SSA15 in Atlantic salmon appears to have arisen by a centric fusion of 2 small acrocentric chromosomes in the common ancestor of Salmo sp. We speculate that the fusion process that produced Atlantic salmon chromosome SSA15 disrupted the ancestral sex-determining locus in the Atlantic salmon lineage, providing the impetus either for the relocation of SEX or selection pressure for a novel sex-determining gene to arise in this species. Thus, the sex-determining genes may differ in Atlantic salmon and brown trout.},

Although recent achievements in genomics will evolve migratory genetics research from a phenotypic to a molecular approach, fully sequenced and annotated genomes of migratory species are still lacking. Consequently, many of the genes involved in migration are unavailable as candidates. Migration is central to the life-history adaptations of many animals. Here, we review current understanding of the genetic architecture of migratory traits and discuss the significant implications this will have for other areas of biology, including population responses to climate change, speciation and conservation management.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Atlantic salmon genome is in the process of returning to a diploid state after undergoing a whole genome duplication (WGD) event between 25 and100 million years ago. Existing data on the proportion of paralogous sequence variants (PSVs), multisite variants (MSVs) and other types of complex sequence variation suggest that the rediplodization phase is far from over. The aims of this study were to construct a high density linkage map for Atlantic salmon, to characterize the extent of rediploidization and to improve our understanding of genetic differences between sexes in this species. RESULTS: A linkage map for Atlantic salmon comprising 29 chromosomes and 5650 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was constructed using genotyping data from 3297 fish belonging to 143 families. Of these, 2696 SNPs were generated from ESTs or other gene associated sequences. Homeologous chromosomal regions were identified through the mapping of duplicated SNPs and through the investigation of syntenic relationships between Atlantic salmon and the reference genome sequence of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The sex-specific linkage maps spanned a total of 2402.3 cM in females and 1746.2 cM in males, highlighting a difference in sex specific recombination rate (1.38:1) which is much lower than previously reported in Atlantic salmon. The sexes, however, displayed striking differences in the distribution of recombination sites within linkage groups, with males showing recombination strongly localized to telomeres. CONCLUSION: The map presented here represents a valuable resource for addressing important questions of interest to evolution (the process of re-diploidization), aquaculture and salmonid life history biology and not least as a resource to aid the assembly of the forthcoming Atlantic salmon reference genome sequence.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the bioinformatic issue of accurately separating amplified genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from artefacts generated during high-throughput sequencing workflows. We fit observed ultra-deep sequencing depths (hundreds to thousands of sequences per amplicon) of allelic variants to expectations from genetic models of copy number variation (CNV). We provide a simple, accurate and repeatable method for genotyping multigene families, evaluating our method via analyses of 209 b of MHC class IIb exon 2 in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Genotype repeatability for resequenced individuals (N = 49) was high (100%) within the same sequencing run. However, repeatability dropped to 83.7% between independent runs, either because of lower mean amplicon sequencing depth in the initial run or random PCR effects. This highlights the importance of fully independent replicates. Significant improvements in genotyping accuracy were made by greatly reducing type I genotyping error (i.e. accepting an artefact as a true allele), which may occur when using low-depth allele validation thresholds used by previous methods. Only a small amount (4.9%) of type II error (i.e. rejecting a genuine allele as an artefact) was detected through fully independent sequencing runs. We observed 1-6 alleles per individual, and evidence of sharing of alleles across loci. Variation in the total number of MHC class II loci among individuals, both among and within populations was also observed, and some genotypes appeared to be partially hemizygous; total allelic dosage added up to an odd number of allelic copies. Collectively, observations provide evidence of MHC CNV and its complex basis in natural populations.},

However, robust detection of selection in wild populations is difficult and often impeded by lack of replicate tests. Here, we investigate selection in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using genome scans coupled with inference from a haploid-assisted linkage map. Pink salmon have a strict 2-year semelparous life history which has resulted in temporally isolated (allochronic) lineages that remain sympatric through sharing of spawning habitats in alternate years. The lineages differ in a range of adaptive traits, suggesting different genetic backgrounds. We used genotyping by sequencing of haploids to generate a high-density linkage map with 7035 loci and screened an existing panel of 8036 loci for signatures of selection. The linkage map enabled identification of novel genomic regions displaying signatures of parallel selection shared between lineages. Furthermore, 24 loci demonstrated divergent selection and differences in genetic diversity between lineages, suggesting that adaptation in the 2 lineages has arisen from different pools of standing genetic variation. Findings have implications for understanding asynchronous population abundances as well as predicting future ecosystem impacts from lineage-specific responses to climate change.},

Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were significantly more centromeric than loci identified by three other techniques (allozymes, microsatellites, and PCR using primer sequences from interspersed nuclear elements). The near absence of AFLPs in distal regions could limit their utility in constructing linkage maps. A large proportion of loci had frequency of second division segregation (y) values approaching 1.0, indicating near complete crossover interference on many chromosome arms. As predicted from models of chromosomal evolution in salmonids based upon results with allozyme loci, all duplicated microsatellite loci that shared alleles (isoloci) had y values of nearly 1.0.},

  Abstract                 = {Allopolyploid speciation is widespread in plants, yet the molecular requirements for successful orchestration of coordinated gene expression for two divergent and reunited genomes are poorly understood. Recent studies in several plant systems have revealed that allopolyploid genesis under both synthetic and natural conditions often is accompanied by rapid and sometimes evolutionarily conserved epigenetic changes, including alteration in cytosine methylation patterns, rapid silencing in ribosomal RNA and protein-coding genes, and de-repression of dormant transposable elements. These changes are inter-related and likely arise from chromatin remodeling and its effects on epigenetic codes during and subsequent to allopolyploid formation. Epigenetic modifications could produce adaptive epimutations and novel phenotypes, some of which may be evolutionarily stable for millions of years, thereby representing a vast reservoir of latent variation that may be episodically released and made visible to selection. This epigenetic variation may contribute to several important attributes of allopolyploidy, including functional diversification or subfunctionalization of duplicated genes, genetic and cytological diploidization, and quenching of incompatible inter-genomic interactions that are characteristic of allopolyploids. It is likely that the evolutionary success of allopolyploidy is in part attributable to epigenetic phenomena that we are only just beginning to understand.},

High-density linkage maps integrated with physical maps and covering the complete genome are needed to identify economically important genes and to study the genome architecture. Linkage maps of moderate density and a physical bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) fingerprint map for the Atlantic salmon have already been generated. Here, we describe a strategy to combine the linkage mapping with the physical integration of newly identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We resequenced 284 BAC-ends by PCR in 14 individuals and detected 180 putative SNPs. After successful validation of 152 sequence variations, genotyping and genetic mapping were performed in eight salmon families comprising 376 individuals. Among these, 110 SNPs were positioned on a previously constructed linkage map containing SNPs derived from expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. Tracing the SNP markers back to the BACs enabled the integration of the genetic and physical maps by assigning 73 BAC contigs to Atlantic salmon linkage groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of its widespread occurrence and role in shaping evolutionary processes in the biological kingdom, especially in plants, polyploidy has been increasingly studied from cytological to molecular levels. By inferring gene order, gene distances and gene homology, linkage mapping with molecular markers has proven powerful for investigating genome structure and organization. Here we review and assess a general statistical model for three-point linkage analysis in autotetraploids by integrating double reduction, a phenomenon that commonly occurs in autopolyploids whose chromosomes are derived from a single ancestral species. This model does not require any assumption on the distribution of the occurrence of double reduction and can handle the complexity of multilocus linkage in terms of crossover interference. Implemented with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms, the model can estimate and test the recombination fractions between less informative dominant markers, thus facilitating its practical implications for any autopolyploids in most of which inexpensive dominant markers are still used for their genetic and evolutionary studies. The model was applied to reanalyze a published data in tetraploid switchgrass, validating its practical usefulness and utilization.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence including allozyme analysis, restriction digest patterns and sequencing of mtDNA as well as mini- and micro-satellite allele frequencies indicate that Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from North America and Europe are genetically distinct. These observations are supported by karyotype analysis, which revealed that North American Atlantic salmon have 27 pairs of chromosomes whereas European salmon have 29 pairs. We set out to construct a linkage map for a North American Atlantic salmon family and to compare this map with the well developed map for European Atlantic salmon. RESULTS: We used microsatellite markers, which had previously been mapped in the two Atlantic salmon SALMAP mapping families from the River Tay, Scotland, to carry out linkage analysis in an Atlantic salmon family (NB1) whose parents were derived from the Saint John River stock in New Brunswick, Canada. As large differences in recombination rates between female and male Atlantic salmon have been noted, separate genetic maps were constructed for each sex. The female linkage map comprises 218 markers in 37 linkage groups while the male map has 226 markers in 28 linkage groups. We combined 280 markers from the female and male maps into 27 composite linkage groups, which correspond to the haploid number of chromosomes in Atlantic salmon from the Western Atlantic. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of the composite NB1 and SALMAP linkage maps revealed the reason for the difference in the chromosome numbers between European and North American Atlantic salmon: Linkage groups AS-4 and AS-32 in the Scottish salmon, which correspond to chromosomes Ssa-6 and Ssa-22, are combined into a single NB1 linkage group as are linkage groups AS-21 and AS-33 (corresponding to chromosomes Ssa-26 and Ssa-28). The comparison of the linkage maps also suggested some additional chromosomal rearrangements, but it will require finer mapping, potentially using SNPs, to test these predictions. Our results provide the first comparison of the genomic architecture of Atlantic salmon from North America and Europe with respect to chromosome organization.},

However, because these new technologies are error prone and yield uneven coverage of alleles in diploid individuals, they also introduce the need for novel methods for analyzing the raw read data. A maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of allele frequencies is developed, eliminating both the need to arbitrarily discard individuals with low coverage and the requirement for an extrinsic measure of the sequence error rate. The resultant estimates are nearly unbiased with asymptotically minimal sampling variance, thereby defining the limits to our ability to estimate population-genetic parameters and providing a logical basis for the optimal design of population-genomic surveys.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection. Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the passive origin of new species.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome duplication (WGD) is often considered to be mechanistically associated with species diversification. Such ideas have been anecdotally attached to a WGD at the stem of the salmonid fish family, but remain untested. Here, we characterized an extensive set of gene paralogues retained from the salmonid WGD, in species covering the major lineages (subfamilies Salmoninae, Thymallinae and Coregoninae). By combining the data in calibrated relaxed molecular clock analyses, we provide the first well-constrained and direct estimate for the timing of the salmonid WGD. Our results suggest that the event occurred no later in time than 88 Ma and that 40-50 Myr passed subsequently until the subfamilies diverged. We also recovered a Thymallinae-Coregoninae sister relationship with maximal support. Comparative phylogenetic tests demonstrated that salmonid diversification patterns are closely allied in time with the continuous climatic cooling that followed the Eocene-Oligocene transition, with the highest diversification rates coinciding with recent ice ages. Further tests revealed considerably higher speciation rates in lineages that evolved anadromy--the physiological capacity to migrate between fresh and seawater--than in sister groups that retained the ancestral state of freshwater residency. Anadromy, which probably evolved in response to climatic cooling, is an established catalyst of genetic isolation, particularly during environmental perturbations (for example, glaciation cycles). We thus conclude that climate-linked ecophysiological factors, rather than WGD, were the primary drivers of salmonid diversification.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy, the condition of possessing more than two complete genomes in a cell, has intrigued biologists for almost a century. Polyploidy is found in many plants and some animal species and today we know that polyploidy has had a role in the evolution of all angiosperms. Despite its widespread occurrence, the direct effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species is still largely unknown. Over the years many attractive hypotheses have been proposed in an attempt to assign functionality to the increased content of a duplicated genome. Among these hypotheses are the proposal that genome doubling confers distinct advantages to a polyploid and that these advantages allow polyploids to thrive in environments that pose challenges to the polyploid's diploid progenitors. This article revisits these long-standing questions and explores how the integration of recent genomic developments with ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspectives has contributed to addressing unresolved problems about the role of polyploidy. Although unsatisfactory, the current conclusion has to be that despite significant progress, there still isn't enough information to unequivocally answer many unresolved questions about cause and effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species. There is, however, reason to believe that the increasingly integrative approaches discussed here should allow us in the future to make more direct connections between the effects of polyploidy on the genome and the responses this condition elicits from the organism living in its natural environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome duplication (WGD) has made a significant contribution to many eukaryotic genomes including yeast, plants, and vertebrates. Following WGD, some ohnologs (WGD paralogs) remain in the genome arranged in blocks of conserved gene order and content (paralogons). However, the most common outcome is loss of one of the ohnolog pair. It is unclear what factors, if any, govern gene loss from paralogons. Recent studies have reported physical clustering (genetic linkage) of functionally linked (interacting) genes in the human genome and propose a biological significance for the clustering of interacting genes such as coexpression or preservation of epistatic interactions. Here we conduct a novel test of a hypothesis that functionally linked genes in the same paralogon are preferentially retained in cis after WGD. We compare the number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between linked singletons within a paralogon (defined as cis-PPIs) with that of PPIs between singletons across paralogon pairs (defined as trans-PPIs). We find that paralogons in which the number of cis-PPIs is greater than that of trans-PPIs are significantly enriched in human and yeast. The trend is similar in plants, but it is difficult to assess statistical significance due to multiple, overlapping WGD events. Interestingly, human singletons participating in cis-PPIs tend to be classified into "response to stimulus." We uncover strong evidence of biased gene loss after WGD, which further supports the hypothesis of biologically significant gene clusters in eukaryotic genomes. These observations give us new insight for understanding the evolution of genome structure and of protein interaction networks.},

For this analysis we derived a simple, closed mathematical formulation for the spectrum of expected allele frequencies when the sampled populations have experienced nonstationary demographic histories. The direct calculation generates the spectrum orders of magnitude faster than coalescent simulations do and allows us to generate spectra for a large number of alternative histories on a multidimensional parameter grid. Model-fitting experiments using this grid reveal significant population-specific differences among the demographic histories that best describe the observed allele frequency spectra. European and Asian spectra show a bottleneck-shaped history: a reduction of effective population size in the past followed by a recent phase of size recovery. In contrast, the African-American spectrum shows a history of moderate but uninterrupted population expansion. These differences are expected to have profound consequences for the design of medical association studies. The analytical methods developed for this study, i.e., a closed mathematical formulation for the allele frequency spectrum, correcting the ascertainment bias introduced by shallow SNP sampling, and dealing with variable sample sizes provide a general framework for the analysis of public variation data.},

Natural selection on specific genetic loci will also affect the variation in linked flanking regions through "hitchhiking" effects, causing greater differentiation between populations than would be expected from purely neutral processes. Here we identify candidate genomic regions for the effects of differential natural selection in two closely related populations of steelhead-rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss separated for the last century following anthropogenic introduction above a barrier waterfall in a coastal California stream. A set of 110 expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked and 188 anonymous microsatellite loci, most of which are mapped, were chosen to provide distributed coverage of all linkage groups in the O. mykiss genome. A genome screen was then performed to identify genomic regions under divergent selection. Multiple complementary statistical methods were used to detect outlier loci, and loci identified by more than one method were considered strong candidates for genomic regions affected by recent natural selection and genomic adaptation to the environment above the waterfall. We identified six strongly supported outlier loci, including one linked to an EST and two located in a genomic region that contains quantitative trait loci associated with egg development, spawning time, and other life history variation. Identification of regions in the genome that are potentially under selection provides valuable information},

Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

  Abstract                 = {In quantitative genetics, multivariate statistical approaches are increasingly used to describe genetic correlations in natural populations, yet the exact genetic relationship between phenotype and genotype is often unknown. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses can be used to describe the molecular basis of this relationship. In salmonids, growth and development are important fitness traits that are phenotypically correlated with each other and with other life-history traits, and an understanding of the molecular basis of these relationships is valuable for future evolutionary studies. Here, a QTL analysis using an outbred cross was initiated to determine the molecular basis of phenotypic correlations between such growth traits in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), an important fish species distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean. Fifty-three QTL for growth rate, length and weight at eight time periods were located on seven linkage groups (OKI03, OKI06, OKI18, OKI19, OKI23, OKI24 and an unnamed linkage group) or associated with five unlinked markers (Omm1159, Omm1367/i, Omy325UoG, OmyRGT55TUF and OtsG422UCD). One QTL for hatch timing was associated with the marker, Omm1241. All QTL were of minor effect, explaining no more than 20% of the observed variation in phenotypic value. Several instances of colocalization of QTL weight, length and growth rate were observed, suggesting a genetic basis for phenotypic correlations observed between these traits. This study lays the foundation for future QTL mapping efforts, for detailed examinations of the genetic basis of phenotypic correlations between growth traits, and for exploring the adaptive significance of growth traits in natural populations.},

Twenty-four linkage groups spanning 287.4 cM were mapped in males, and 33 linkage groups spanning 429.7 cM were mapped in females. Several male linkage groups corresponded to two female linkage groups. The combination of linkage groups across both sexes appeared to characterize regions of 26 chromosomes. Two homeologous chromosomes were identified based on information from duplicated loci. Homologies between the coho and rainbow trout maps were examined. Eighty-six loci were found to form common linkage relationships between the two maps; these relationships provided evidence for whole-arm fissions, fusions and conservation of chromosomal regions in the evolution of these two species.},

  Abstract                 = {The strict homing of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka results in reproductively isolated populations that often spawn in close proximity and share rearing habitat. High spawning fidelity enables these populations to adapt to local conditions, resulting in a wide range of life history characteristics and genetic variation within individual watersheds. The Wood River system in southwestern Alaska provides a pristine, well-studied system in which to examine fine-scale population structure and its influences on juvenile life histories. Adult sockeye salmon spawn in lake beaches, rivers, and small tributaries throughout this watershed, and juveniles rear in five nursery lakes. We genotyped 30 spawning populations and 6,066 migrating smolts at 45 single nucleotide polymorphism loci, two of which are candidates for positive selection in the study system. We show that there is significant genetic structure (F-ST = 0.032) in the Wood River lakes and that divergence is generally related to spawning rather than nursery habitat (hierarchical analysis of molecular variance; P < 0.05). Four groups of populations were identified based on genetic structure and used to determine the composition of unknown mixtures of migrating smolts using a Bayesian modeling framework. We demonstrate that smolt migration timing is related to genetic structure; stream and river populations dominate catches in early June, while beach spawners and the populations in Lake Kulik are more prevalent from mid-June to early September. Age-2 smolts are primarily produced by the Lake Kulik and beach spawning populations, showing that genetic differences may reflect divergent freshwater and migration life history strategies.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms provide an important tool for species identification in studies of hybridization and introgression between these two species, but until now the time-consuming and costly nature of DNA sequencing has limited identification of new markers.

  Abstract                 = {Polyploids are traditionally classified into allopolyploids and autopolyploids, based on their evolutionary origin and their disomic or multisomic mode of inheritance. Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that there is a continuum between disomic and multisomic inheritance, with the rate of tetrasomy differing among species and among chromosomes within species. Here, we use a simple population genetic model to study the impact of the mode of inheritance on the genetic diversity and population divergence of tetraploids. We found that under almost strict disomic inheritance the tetraploid genome is divided into two separate subgenomes, such as found in classical allopolyploids. In those cases, assuming full tetrasomy in the analysis of polyploid genetic data will lead to an important bias in estimates of genetic diversity and population divergence. However, we found that even a low rate of allele exchange between the two subgenomes, at about one event per generation, is sufficient to homogenise the allele frequencies over the subgenomes, and the estimates become essentially unbiased. The inbreeding coefficient F(IS) can then be used to detect whether the estimates of diversity and divergence will be biased when full multisomy is assumed. Finally, we found that different summary statistics for measuring the strength of population differentiation are differentially affected by a deviation from full tetrasomy. Our model results provide several useful guidelines for the analysis of polyploid data, helping researchers to determine when their inferences are biased and which summary statistics to use.},

We identified a common genomic profile that was correlated with survival in each study. In ocean-tagged fish, a mortality-related genomic signature was associated with a 13.5-fold greater chance of dying en route. In river-tagged fish, the same genomic signature was associated with a 50% increase in mortality before reaching the spawning grounds in one of three stocks tested. At the spawning grounds, the same signature was associated with 3.7-fold greater odds of dying without spawning. Functional analysis raises the possibility that the mortality-related signature reflects a viral infection.},

This extensive local adaptation makes conservation and restoration of salmonids a challenge. For example, defining unambiguous units of conservation is difficult, and restoration attempts often fail owing to inadequate adaptive matching of translocated populations. A better understanding of the genetic architecture of local adaptation in salmonids could provide valuable information to assist in conserving and restoring natural populations of these important species. Here, we use a combination of laboratory crosses and next-generation sequencing to investigate the genetic architecture of the parallel adaptation of rapid development rate in two geographically and genetically distant populations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Strikingly, we find that not only is a parallel genetic mechanism used but that a conserved haplotype is responsible for this intriguing adaptation. The repeated use of adaptive genetic variation across distant geographical areas could be a general theme in salmonids and have important implications for conservation and restoration.},

  Abstract                 = {Restriction site associated DNA (RAD) tags are a genome-wide representation of every site of a particular restriction enzyme by short DNA tags. Most organisms segregate large numbers of DNA sequence polymorphisms that disrupt restriction sites, which allows RAD tags to serve as genetic markers spread at a high density throughout the genome. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of RAD markers for both individual and bulk-segregant genotyping. First, we show that these markers can be identified and typed on pre-existing microarray formats. Second, we present a method that uses RAD marker DNA to rapidly produce a low-cost microarray genotyping resource that can be used to efficiently identify and type thousands of RAD markers. We demonstrate the utility of the former approach by using a tiling path array for the fruit fly to map a recombination breakpoint, and the latter approach by creating and using an enriched RAD marker array for the threespine stickleback. The high number of RAD markers enabled localization of a previously identified region, as well as a second region also associated with the lateral plate phenotype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RAD markers, and the method to develop a RAD marker microarray resource, allow high-throughput, high-resolution genotyping in both model and nonmodel systems.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is one of the most prevalent and economically devastating diseases in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming worldwide. The disease causes large mortalities at both the fry- and post-smolt stages. Family selection for increased IPN resistance is performed through the use of controlled challenge tests, where survival rates of sib-groups are recorded. However, since challenge-tested animals cannot be used as breeding candidates, within-family selection is not performed and only half of the genetic variation for IPN resistance is being exploited. DNA markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting IPN resistance would therefore be a powerful selection tool. The aim of this study was to identify and fine-map QTL for IPN-resistance in Atlantic salmon, for use in marker-assisted selection to increase the rate of genetic improvement for this trait. RESULTS: A genome scan was carried out using 10 large full-sib families of challenge-tested Atlantic salmon post-smolts and microsatellite markers distributed across the genome. One major QTL for IPN-resistance was detected, explaining 29% and 83% of the phenotypic and genetic variances, respectively. This QTL mapped to the same location as a QTL recently detected in a Scottish Atlantic salmon population. The QTL was found to be segregating in 10 out of 20 mapping parents, and subsequent fine-mapping with additional markers narrowed the QTL peak to a 4 cM region on linkage group 21. Challenge-tested fry were used to show that the QTL had the same effect on fry as on post-smolt, with the confidence interval for QTL position in fry overlapping the confidence interval found in post-smolts. A total of 178 parents were tested for segregation of the QTL, identifying 72 QTL-heterozygous parents. Genotypes at QTL-heterozygous parents were used to determine linkage phases between alleles at the underlying DNA polymorphism and alleles at single markers or multi-marker haplotypes. One four-marker haplotype was found to be the best predictor of QTL alleles, and was successfully used to deduce genotypes of the underlying polymorphism in 72% of the parents of the next generation within a breeding nucleus. A highly significant population-level correlation was found between deduced alleles at the underlying polymorphism and survival of offspring groups in the fry challenge test, parents with the three deduced genotypes (QQ, Qq, qq) having mean offspring mortality rates of 0.13, 0.32, and 0.49, respectively. The frequency of the high-resistance allele (Q) in the population was estimated to be 0.30. Apart from this major QTL, one other experiment-wise significant QTL for IPN-resistance was detected, located on linkage group 4. CONCLUSION: The QTL confirmed in this study represents a case of a major gene explaining the bulk of genetic variation for a presumed complex trait. QTL genotypes were deduced within most parents of the 2005 generation of a major breeding company, providing a solid framework for linkage-based MAS within the whole population in subsequent generations. Since haplotype-trait associations valid at the population level were found, there is also a potential for MAS based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). However, in order to use MAS across many generations without reassessment of linkage phases between markers and the underlying polymorphism, the QTL needs to be positioned with even greater accuracy. This will require higher marker densities than are currently available.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Atlantic salmon is a species of commercial and ecological significance. Like other salmonids, the species displays residual tetrasomy and a large difference in recombination rate between sexes. Linkage maps with full genome coverage, containing both type I and type II markers, are needed for progress in genomics. Furthermore, it is important to estimate levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the species. In this study, we developed several hundred single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Atlantic salmon, and constructed male and female linkage maps containing SNP and microsatellite markers. We also investigated further the distribution of male and female recombination events across the genome, and estimated levels of LD between pairs of markers. RESULTS: The male map had 29 linkage groups and was 390 cM long. The female map had 30 linkage groups as was 1983 cM long. In total, the maps contained 138 microsatellite markers and 304 SNPs located within genes, most of which were successfully annotated. The ratio of male to female recombination events was either close to zero or very large, indicating that there is little overlap between regions in which male and female crossovers occur. The female map is likely to have close to full genome coverage, while the majority of male linkage groups probably lack markers in telomeric regions where male recombination events occur. Levels of r2 increased with decreasing inter-marker distance in a bimodal fashion; increasing slowly from approximately 60 cM, and more rapidly more from approximately 12 cM. Long-ranging LD may be consequence of recent admixture in the population, the population being a 'synthetic' breeding population with contributions from several distinct rivers. Levels of r2 dropped to half its maximum value (above baseline) within 15 cM, and were higher than 0.2 above baseline for unlinked markers ('useful LD') at inter-marker distances less than 5 cM. CONCLUSION: The linkage map presented here is an important resource for genetic, comparative, and physical mapping of the Atlantic salmon. The female map is likely to have a map coverage that is not far from complete, whereas the male map length is likely to be significantly shorter than the true map, due to suboptimal marker coverage in the apparently small physical regions where male crossovers occur. 'Useful LD' was found at inter-marker distances less than 5 cM.},

  Abstract                 = {A genetic linkage map of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was constructed, using 54 microsatellites and 473 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The mapping population consisted of two full-sib families within one paternal half-sib family from the Norwegian breeding population. A mapping strategy was developed that facilitated the construction of separate male and female maps, while retaining all the information contributed by the dominant AFLP markers. By using this strategy, we were able to map a significant number of the AFLP markers for which all informative offspring had two heterozygous parents; these markers then served as bridges between the male and female maps. The female map spanned 901 cM and had 33 linkage groups, while the male spanned 103 cM and had 31 linkage groups. Twenty-five linkage groups were common between the two maps. The construction of the genetic map revealed a large difference in recombination rate between females and males. The ratio of female recombination rate vs. male recombination rate was 8.26, the highest ratio reported for any vertebrate. This map constitutes the first linkage map of Atlantic salmon, one of the most important aquaculture species worldwide.},

  Abstract                 = {Most organisms, including ourselves, are exposed to environmental stressors at various points during life, and responses to such stressors have been optimised by evolution to give the best fitness outcomes. It is expected that environmental change will substantially increase long-term stress exposure in many animal groups in the coming decades. A major challenge for biologists is to understand and predict how this will influence individuals, populations and ecosystems, and over what time scale such effects will occur. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, combining studies of mechanisms with studies of fitness consequences for individuals and their descendants. In this review, I discuss the positive and negative fitness consequences of responses to stressful environments, particularly during early life, and with an emphasis on studies in birds. As many of the mechanisms underlying stress responses are highly conserved across the vertebrate groups, the findings from these studies have general applicability when interpreted in a life history context. One important route that has recently been identified whereby chronic stress exposure can affect health and longevity over long time frames is via effects on telomere dynamics. Much of this work has so far been done on humans, and is correlational in nature, but studies on other taxa, and experimental work, are increasing. I summarise the relevant aspects of vertebrate telomere biology and critically appraise our current knowledge with a view to pointing out important future research directions for our understanding of how stress exposure influences life histories.},

  Abstract                 = {Connecting broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and population structure to genetic diversity on a landscape is a key step towards understanding historical processes of migration and adaptation. New genomic approaches can be used to increase the resolution of phylogeographic studies while reducing locus sampling effects and circumventing ascertainment bias. Here, we use a novel approach based on high-throughput sequencing to characterize genetic diversity in complete chloroplast genomes and >10,000 nuclear loci in switchgrass, at continental and landscape scales. Switchgrass is a North American tallgrass species, which is widely used in conservation and perennial biomass production, and shows strong ecotypic adaptation and population structure across the continental range. We sequenced 40.9 billion base pairs from 24 individuals from across the species' range and 20 individuals from the Indiana Dunes. Analysis of plastome sequence revealed 203 variable SNP sites that define eight haplogroups, which are differentiated by 4-127 SNPs and confirmed by patterns of indel variation. These include three deeply divergent haplogroups, which correspond to the previously described lowland-upland ecotypic split and a novel upland haplogroup split that dates to the mid-Pleistocene. Most of the plastome haplogroup diversity present in the northern switchgrass range, including in the Indiana Dunes, originated in the mid- or upper Pleistocene prior to the most recent postglacial recolonization. Furthermore, a recently colonized landscape feature (approximately 150 ya) in the Indiana Dunes contains several deeply divergent upland haplogroups. Nuclear markers also support a deep lowland-upland split, followed by limited gene flow, and show extensive gene flow in the local population of the Indiana Dunes.},

  Abstract                 = {Bird migration is one of the most spectacular and best-studied phenomena in behavioural biology. Yet, while the patterns of variation in migratory behaviour and its ecological causes have been intensively studied, its genetic, physiological and neurological control remains poorly understood. The lack of knowledge of the molecular basis of migration is currently not only limiting our insight into the proximate control of migration, but also into its evolution. We investigated polymorphisms in the exons of six candidate genes for key behavioural traits potentially linked to migration, which had previously been identified in several bird species, and eight control loci in 14 populations of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), representing the whole range of geographical variation in migration patterns found in this species, with the aim of identifying genes controlling variation in migration. We found a consistent association between a microsatellite polymorphism and migratory behaviour only at one candidate locus: the ADCYAP1 gene. This polymorphism explained about 2.6 per cent of the variation in migratory tendency among populations, and 2.7-3.5% of variation in migratory restlessness among individuals within two independent populations. In all tests, longer alleles were associated with higher migratory activity. The consistency of results among different populations and levels of analysis suggests that ADCYAP1 is one of the genes controlling the expression of migratory behaviour. Moreover, the multiple described functions of the gene product indicate that this gene might act at multiple levels modifying the shift between migratory and non-migratory states.},

  Abstract                 = {Ceratomyxa shasta is enzootic to some rivers of the Pacific Northwest and California, and has caused extensive mortalities of salmonids, the only known host of the actinosporean stage of the pathogen. Mortalities from C. shasta are induced by severe inflammation and necrosis of the intestinal tract, and no therapeutants have been discovered for the treatment of ceratomyxosis. Inheritance studies by previous investigators suggested that C. shasta resistance is genetically controlled, but none have revealed the number and locations of gene regions associated with resistance. Here, we characterized differences in resistance among clonal lines, and used line crosses between clonal lines with resistance differences for a genetic analysis of C. shasta resistance in Oncorhynchus mykiss, following a short term in situ exposure to the pathogen. We found that Oregon State University (OSU) x Arlee (ARL) clonal hybrids were highly susceptible, while OSU x Clearwater (CW) hybrids were highly resistant to C. shasta. Doubled haploids, produced by androgenesis from an F1 hybrid between the OSU and CW lines, were evaluated for the co-segregation of molecular markers and resistance phenotype. Amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers, used to construct a genetic linkage map in this cross, were tested for associations with resistance expressed as absolute survival (binary trait) and days to death (survival analysis). Segregation of the resistance phenotype suggested that the resistance was inherited as a single Mendelian locus, but the binary trait failed to map to a single genomic location. Markers identified in single-marker analyses were used in multiple-regression model selection, within both the linear regression and Cox proportional-hazards survival analysis frameworks, to determine the number and potential location of loci simultaneously contributing to variation in the survival phenotypes of doubled-haploid progeny. We found multiple genomic loci associated with C. shasta resistance through these models, confirming studies by previous investigators that suggested C. shasta resistance is polygenic.},

  Abstract                 = {The timing and propensity for migration between fresh- and seawater is a key theme in the diversity of life histories within the salmonid fishes. Across salmonid species, life-history strategies range from wholly freshwater-resident populations, to migratory and nonmigratory variation within populations, to populations and species that are primarily migratory. Despite the central theme of migration to the evolution of these fishes, the genetic architecture of migration-related processes is poorly understood. Using a genetic cross of clonal lines derived from migratory and nonmigratory life-history types of Onchorhynchus mykiss (steelhead and rainbow trout, respectively), we have dissected the genetic architecture of the complex physiological and morphological transformation that occurs immediately prior to seaward migration (termed smoltification). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses were used to identify the number, effects, and genomic location of loci associated with smoltification-related traits, including growth and condition factor, body coloration, morphology, and osmoregulatory enzymes during the smoltification period. Genetic analyses revealed numerous QTL, but one locus in particular is associated with multiple traits in single and joint analyses. Dissecting the genetic architecture of this highly complex trait has profound implications for understanding the genetic and evolutionary basis of life-history diversity within and among migratory fishes.},

  Abstract                 = {Meristic trait variation among species and populations has long been used as the basis for identification and classification of fishes. Within Oncorhynchus mykiss, there is considerable variation in meristic characters such as numbers of vertebrae, lateral line scales, fin rays, gill rakers, and pyloric caeca. In our laboratory the Oregon State University (OSU) rainbow trout and the Clearwater River (CW) steelhead trout clonal lines, produced by androgenesis, exhibit significant differences in values for meristic traits, making quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of these meristic characters possible. Our objective was to determine the number, location, and effects of QTL associated with meristic characters in order to test two hypotheses: (1) that QTL for different meristic traits co-localize to the same linkage group and (2) that meristic trait QTL co-localize to the same linkage group as a previously identified development rate QTL. Doubled haploid individuals, produced by androgenesis from sperm from an F-1 hybrid between the OSU and CW lines, were used to evaluate the joint segregation of each meristic phenotype and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphic marker genotypes. Composite interval mapping revealed QTL for six of the seven traits analyzed. One QTL each for scales above the lateral line and for gill rakers co-localized to the same position. Only one QTL for scales above the lateral line co-localized to the same region as that for the development rate QTL, but a greater map resolution is necessary to determine if these loci are truly the same. We failed to detect pleiotropy for most meristic trait QTL. Our results suggest that different major loci are associated with variation in each meristic character and that the expression of these loci may be influenced by maternal and external environmental factors.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The capacity to maintain internal ion homeostasis amidst changing conditions is particularly important for teleost fishes whose reproductive cycle is dependent upon movement from freshwater to seawater. Although the physiology of seawater osmoregulation in mitochondria-rich cells of fish gill epithelium is well understood, less is known about the underlying causes of inter- and intraspecific variation in salinity tolerance. We used a genome-scan approach in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) correlated with variation in four salinity tolerance performance traits and six body size traits. Comparative genomics approaches allowed us to infer whether allelic variation at candidate gene loci (e.g., ATP1alpha1b, NKCC1, CFTR, and cldn10e) could have underlain observed variation. RESULTS: Combined parental analyses yielded genome-wide significant QTL on linkage groups 8, 14 and 20 for salinity tolerance performance traits, and on 1, 19, 20 and 28 for body size traits. Several QTL exhibited chromosome-wide significance. Among the salinity tolerance performance QTL, trait co-localizations occurred on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 18 and 20, while the greatest experimental variation was explained by QTL on chromosomes 20 (19.9%), 19 (14.2%), 4 (14.1%) and 12 (13.1%). Several QTL localized to linkage groups exhibiting homeologous affinities, and multiple QTL mapped to regions homologous with the positions of candidate gene loci in other teleosts. There was no gene x environment interaction among body size QTL and ambient salinity. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in salinity tolerance capacity can be mapped to a subset of Arctic charr genomic regions that significantly influence performance in a seawater environment. The detection of QTL on linkage group 12 was consistent with the hypothesis that variation in salinity tolerance may be affected by allelic variation at the ATP1alpha1b locus. IGF2 may also affect salinity tolerance capacity as suggested by a genome-wide QTL on linkage group 19. The detection of salinity tolerance QTL in homeologous regions suggests that candidate loci duplicated from the salmonid-specific whole-genome duplication may have retained their function on both sets of homeologous chromosomes. Homologous affinities suggest that loci affecting salinity tolerance in Arctic charr may coincide with QTL for smoltification and salinity tolerance traits in rainbow trout. The effects of body size QTL appear to be independent of changes in ambient salinity.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation is a fundamental process responsible for the diversity of life. Progress has been made in detecting individual 'speciation genes' that cause reproductive isolation. In contrast, until recently, less attention has been given to genome-wide patterns of divergence during speciation. Thus, major questions remain concerning how individual speciation genes are arrayed within the genome, and how this affects speciation. This theme issue is dedicated to exploring this genomic perspective of speciation. Given recent sequencing and computational advances that now allow genomic analyses in most organisms, the goal is to help move the field towards a more integrative approach. This issue draws upon empirical studies in plants and animals, and theoretical work, to review and further document patterns of genomic divergence. In turn, these studies begin to disentangle the role that different processes, such as natural selection, gene flow and recombination rate, play in generating observed patterns. These factors are considered in the context of how genomes diverge as speciation unfolds, from beginning to end. The collective results point to how experimental work is now required, in conjunction with theory and sequencing studies, to move the field from descriptive studies of patterns of divergence towards a predictive framework that tackles the causes and consequences of genome-wide patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Levels of genetic differentiation between populations can be highly variable across the genome, with divergent selection contributing to such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) 'outlier loci' with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality, and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation across population pairs ['isolation by adaptation' (IBA)]. The latter pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased. Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and literatures. We find that studies generally report 5-10% of loci to be outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome, commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e. genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Diverse geographical modes and mechanisms of speciation are known, and individual speciation genes have now been identified. Despite this progress, genome-wide outcomes of different evolutionary processes during speciation are less understood. Here, we integrate ecological and spatial information, mating trials, transplantation data and analysis of 86 130 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight populations (28 pairwise comparisons) of Timema cristinae stick insects to test the effects of different factors on genomic divergence in a system undergoing ecological speciation. We find patterns consistent with effects of numerous factors, including geographical distance, gene flow, divergence in host plant use and climate, and selection against maladaptive hybridization (i.e. reinforcement). For example, the number of highly differentiated 'outlier loci', allele-frequency clines and the overall distribution of genomic differentiation were recognizably affected by these factors. Although host use has strong effects on phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation, its effects on genomic divergence were subtler and other factors had pronounced effects. The results demonstrate how genomic data can provide new insights into speciation and how genomic divergence can be complex, yet predictable. Future work could adopt experimental, mapping and functional approaches to directly test which genetic regions are affected by selection and determine their physical location in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Salmonid genomes are considered to be in a pseudo-tetraploid state as a result of a genome duplication event that occurred between 25 and 100 Ma. This situation complicates single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in rainbow trout as many putative SNPs are actually paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) and not simple allelic variants. To differentiate PSVs from simple allelic variants, we used 19 homozygous doubled haploid (DH) lines that represent a wide geographical range of rainbow trout populations. In the first phase of the study, we analysed SbfI restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequence data from all the 19 lines and selected 11 lines for an extended SNP discovery. In the second phase, we conducted the extended SNP discovery using PstI RAD sequence data from the selected 11 lines. The complete data set is composed of 145,168 high-quality putative SNPs that were genotyped in at least nine of the 11 lines, of which 71,446 (49%) had minor allele frequencies (MAF) of at least 18% (i.e. at least two of the 11 lines). Approximately 14% of the RAD SNPs in this data set are from expressed or coding rainbow trout sequences. Our comparison of the current data set with previous SNP discovery data sets revealed that 99% of our SNPs are novel. In the support files for this resource, we provide annotation to the positions of the SNPs in the working draft of the rainbow trout reference genome, provide the genotypes of each sample in the discovery panel and identify SNPs that are likely to be in coding sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA fingerprints and end sequences from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) from two new libraries were generated to improve the first generation integrated physical and genetic map of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genome. The current version of the physical map is composed of 167,989 clones of which 158,670 are assembled into contigs and 9,319 are singletons. The number of contigs was reduced from 4,173 to 3,220. End sequencing of clones from the new libraries generated a total of 11,958 high quality sequence reads. The end sequences were used to develop 238 new microsatellites of which 42 were added to the genetic map. Conserved synteny between the rainbow trout genome and model fish genomes was analyzed using 188,443 BAC end sequence (BES) reads. The fractions of BES reads with significant BLASTN hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback genomes were 8.8%, 9.7%, and 10.5%, respectively, while the fractions of significant BLASTX hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback protein databases were 6.2%, 5.8%, and 5.5%, respectively. The overall number of unique regions of conserved synteny identified through grouping of the rainbow trout BES into fingerprinting contigs was 2,259, 2,229, and 2,203 for stickleback, medaka, and zebrafish, respectively. These numbers are approximately three to five times greater than those we have previously identified using BAC paired ends. Clustering of the conserved synteny analysis results by linkage groups as derived from the integrated physical and genetic map revealed that despite the low sequence homology, large blocks of macrosynteny are conserved between chromosome arms of rainbow trout and the model fish species.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are the most-widely cultivated cold freshwater fish in the world and an important model species for many research areas. Coupling great interest in this species as a research model with the need for genetic improvement of aquaculture production efficiency traits justifies the continued development of genomics research resources. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for production and life-history traits in rainbow trout. An integrated physical and genetic map is needed to facilitate fine mapping of QTL and the selection of positional candidate genes for incorporation in marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs for improving rainbow trout aquaculture production. RESULTS: The first generation integrated map of the rainbow trout genome is composed of 238 BAC contigs anchored to chromosomes of the genetic map. It covers more than 10% of the genome across segments from all 29 chromosomes. Anchoring of 203 contigs to chromosomes of the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA) genetic map was achieved through mapping of 288 genetic markers derived from BAC end sequences (BES), screening of the BAC library with previously mapped markers and matching of SNPs with BES reads. In addition, 35 contigs were anchored to linkage groups of the INRA (French National Institute of Agricultural Research) genetic map through markers that were not informative for linkage analysis in the NCCCWA mapping panel. The ratio of physical to genetic linkage distances varied substantially among chromosomes and BAC contigs with an average of 3,033 Kb/cM. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated map described here provides a framework for a robust composite genome map for rainbow trout. This resource is needed for genomic analyses in this research model and economically important species and will facilitate comparative genome mapping with other salmonids and with model fish species. This resource will also facilitate efforts to assemble a whole-genome reference sequence for rainbow trout.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are the most-widely cultivated cold freshwater fish in the world and an important model species for many research areas. Coupling great interest in this species as a research model with the need for genetic improvement of aquaculture production efficiency traits justifies the continued development of genomics research resources. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for production and life-history traits in rainbow trout. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) physical map is needed to facilitate fine mapping of QTL and the selection of positional candidate genes for incorporation in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for improving rainbow trout aquaculture production. This resource will also facilitate efforts to obtain and assemble a whole-genome reference sequence for this species. RESULTS: The physical map was constructed from DNA fingerprinting of 192,096 BAC clones using the 4-color high-information content fingerprinting (HICF) method. The clones were assembled into physical map contigs using the finger-printing contig (FPC) program. The map is composed of 4,173 contigs and 9,379 singletons. The total number of unique fingerprinting fragments (consensus bands) in contigs is 1,185,157, which corresponds to an estimated physical length of 2.0 Gb. The map assembly was validated by 1) comparison with probe hybridization results and agarose gel fingerprinting contigs; and 2) anchoring large contigs to the microsatellite-based genetic linkage map. CONCLUSION: The production and validation of the first BAC physical map of the rainbow trout genome is described in this paper. We are currently integrating this map with the NCCCWA genetic map using more than 200 microsatellites isolated from BAC end sequences and by identifying BACs that harbor more than 300 previously mapped markers. The availability of an integrated physical and genetic map will enable detailed comparative genome analyses, fine mapping of QTL, positional cloning, selection of positional candidate genes for economically important traits and the incorporation of MAS into rainbow trout breeding programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Autopolyploidy is more common in plants than traditionally assumed, but has received little attention compared with allopolyploidy. Hence, the advantages and disadvantages of genome doubling per se compared with genome doubling coupled with hybridizations in allopolyploids remain unclear. Autopolyploids are characterized by genomic redundancy and polysomic inheritance, increasing effective population size. To shed light on the evolutionary consequences of autopolyploidy, we review a broad range of studies focusing on both synthetic and natural autopolyploids encompassing levels of biological organization from genes to evolutionary lineages. The limited evidence currently available suggests that autopolyploids neither experience strong genome restructuring nor wide reorganization of gene expression during the first generations following genome doubling, but that these processes may become more important in the longer term. Biogeographic and ecological surveys point to an association between the formation of autopolyploid lineages and environmental change. We thus hypothesize that polysomic inheritance may provide a short-term evolutionary advantage for autopolyploids compared to diploid relatives when environmental change enforces range shifts. In addition, autopolyploids should possess increased genome flexibility, allowing them to adapt and persist across heterogeneous landscapes in the long run.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to estimate the effective population size (Ne) of the current human population, two new approaches, which were derived from previous methods, were used in this study. One is based on the deviation from linkage equilibrium (LE) between completely unlinked loci in different chromosomes and another is based on the deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). When random mating in a population is assumed, genetic drifts in population naturally induce linkage disequilibrium (LD) between chromosomes and the deviation from HWE. The latter provides information on the Ne of the current population, and the former provides the same when the Ne is constant. If Ne fluctuates, recent Ne changes are reflected in the estimates based on LE, and the comparison between two estimates can provide information regarding recent changes of Ne. Using HapMap Phase III data, the estimates were varied from 622 to 10 437, depending on populations and estimates. The Ne appeared to fluctuate as it provided different estimates for each of the two methods. These Ne estimates were found to agree approximately with the overall increment observed in recent human populations.},

We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid adaptation to novel environments may drive changes in genomic regions through natural selection. Such changes may be population-specific or, alternatively, may involve parallel evolution of the same genomic region in multiple populations, if that region contains genes or co-adapted gene complexes affecting the selected trait(s). Both quantitative and population genetic approaches have identified associations between specific genomic regions and the anadromous (steelhead) and resident (rainbow trout) life-history strategies of Oncorhynchus mykiss. Here, we use genotype data from 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms and show that the distribution of variation in a large region of one chromosome, Omy5, is strongly associated with life-history differentiation in multiple above-barrier populations of rainbow trout and their anadromous steelhead ancestors. The associated loci are in strong linkage disequilibrium, suggesting the presence of a chromosomal inversion or other rearrangement limiting recombination. These results provide the first evidence of a common genomic basis for life-history variation in O. mykiss in a geographically diverse set of populations and extend our knowledge of the heritable basis of rapid adaptation of complex traits in novel habitats.},

Two grandsires and several granddams in each strain were bred to create 63 second-generation pure strain families which were bred in turn to form 118 mixed third-generation half sib families (n = 5752). Heritability was high for all three traits (h(UTT)(2)=0.41 +/- 0.07; h(BW)(2)=0.46 +/- 0.04; h(Kf)(2)=0.52 +/- 0.04) in an extended animal model including terms for strain origin and hybrid effects. Genetic correlations between UTT an dBW were essentially zero (r(a)=-0.03 +/- 0.18), positive between UTT and K-r (r(a)=0.49 +/- 0.13) and positive between BW and K-f (r(a)=0.11 +/- 0.08). RS fish had higher UTT (alpha = 303 deg min) but lower BW (alpha=-0.19 g) and K-f (-0.032 g (mm(3))(-1) than SV fish, suggesting fixed genetic effects of strains. However, only genetic variance for UTT appeared to be biased upwards by 2 the failure to include strain effects in heritability estimation (h(UTT)=0.48 +/- 0.08). Failure to account for strain effects also resulted in slight overestimation of genetic correlation between UTT and BW (r(a)=-0.17 vs. -0.03) but partial underestimates between UTT and K-f(0.29 vs 0.49). Hybrid fish were less thermotolerant (alpha=-59 +/- 15 deg min) and heavier (0.16 +/- 0.049 g) but had lower K-f (-0.023 g (mm(3))(-1)) than pure strain individuals, but hybrid effects accounted for relatively litte genetic variance overall. Our results indicate substantial selective potential on these traits, but that the efficacy of selection for certain traits might depend on more complex genetic architecture. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Numerous empirical studies have reported lack of migration-drift equilibrium in wild populations. Determining the causes of nonequilibrium population structure is challenging because different evolutionary processes acting at a variety of spatiotemporal scales can produce similar patterns. Studies of contemporary populations in northern latitudes suggest that nonequilibrium population structure is probably caused by recent colonization of the region after the last Pleistocene ice age ended ~13,000 years ago. The chum salmon's (Oncorhynchus keta) range was fragmented by dramatic environmental changes during the Pleistocene. We investigated the population structure of chum salmon on the North Alaska Peninsula (NAP) and, using both empirical data and simulations, evaluated the effects of colonization timing and founder population heterogeneity on patterns of genetic differentiation. We screened 161 single nucleotide polymorphisms and found evidence of nonequilibrium population structure when the slope of the isolation-by-distance relationship was examined at incremental spatial scales. In addition, simulations suggested that this pattern closely matched models of recent colonization of the NAP by secondary contact. Our results agree with geological and archaeological data indicating that the NAP was a dynamic landscape that may have been more recently colonized than during the last deglaciation because of dramatic changes in coastal hydrology over the last several thousand years.},

  Abstract                 = {A mapping population was created to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis subsp. graminicola in Lolium perenne. A susceptible and a resistant plant were crossed to produce a pseudo-testcross population of 193 F(1) individuals. Markers were produced by the restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) process, which uses massively parallel and multiplexed sequencing of reduced-representation libraries. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were combined with the RAD markers to produce maps for the female (738 cM) and male (721 cM) parents. Stem rust phenotypes (number of pustules per plant) were determined in replicated greenhouse trials by inoculation with a field-collected, genetically heterogeneous population of urediniospores. The F(1) progeny displayed continuous distribution of phenotypes and transgressive segregation. We detected three resistance QTL. The most prominent QTL (qLpPg1) is located near 41 cM on linkage group (LG) 7 with a 2-LOD interval of 8 cM, and accounts for 30-38% of the stem rust phenotypic variance. QTL were detected also on LG1 (qLpPg2) and LG6 (qLpPg3), each accounting for approximately 10% of phenotypic variance. Alleles of loci closely linked to these QTL originated from the resistant parent for qLpPg1 and from both parents for qLpPg2 and qLpPg3. Observed quantitative nature of the resistance may be due to partial-resistance effects against all pathogen genotypes, or qualitative effects completely preventing infection by only some genotypes in the genetically mixed inoculum. RAD markers facilitated rapid construction of new genetic maps in this outcrossing species and will enable development of sequence-based markers linked to stem rust resistance in L. perenne.},

  Abstract                 = {The karyotypes of salmonid fishes including taxa in the three subfamilies Coregoninae, Thymallinae and Salmoninae are described. This review is an update of the (Hartley, 1987) review of the chromosomes of salmonid fishes. As described in the previous review, the karyotypes of salmonid fishes fall into two main categories based on chromosome numbers: the type A karyotypes have diploid numbers close to 80 with approximately 100 chromosome arms (2n = 80, NF = 100), and the type B karyotypes have diploid numbers close to 60 with approximately 100 chromosome arms (2n = 60, NF = 100). In this paper we have proposed additional sub categories based on variation in the number of chromosome arms: the A' type with NF = 110-120, the A" type with NF greater than 140, and the B' type with NF less than 80. Two modes of chromosome evolution are found in the salmonids: in the Coregoninae and the Salmoninae the chromosomes have evolved by centric fusions of the Robertsonian type decreasing chromosome numbers (2n) while retaining chromosome arm numbers (NF) close to that found in the hypothetical tetraploid ancestor so that most extant taxa have either type A or type B karyotypes. In the Thymallinae, the chromosomes have evolved by inversions so that chromosome arm numbers (NF) have increased but chromosome numbers (2n) close to the karyotype of the hypothetical tetraploid ancestor have been retained and all taxa have type A' karyotypes. Most of the taxa with type B karyotypes in the Coregoninae and Salmoninae are members of the genus Oncorhynchus, although at least one example of type B karyotypes is found in all of the other genera. These taxa either have an anadromous life history or are found in specialized lacustrine environments. Selection for increases or decreases in genetic recombination as proposed by Qumsiyeh, 1994 could have been involved in the evolution of chromosome number in salmonid fishes.},

Both of these chromosome pairs are morphologically different from the sex chromosome pairs in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The 5S rRNA genes are on multiple chromosome pairs including the sex chromosome pair in chum salmon, but at the centromeres of two autosomal metacentric pairs in pink salmon.

  Abstract                 = {The previous genetic mapping data have suggested that most of the rainbow trout sex chromosome pair is pseudoautosomal, with very small X-specific and Y-specific regions. We have prepared an updated genetic and cytogenetic map of the male rainbow trout sex linkage group. Selected sex-linked markers spanning the X chromosome of the female genetic map have been mapped cytogenetically in normal males and genetically in crosses between the OSU female clonal line and four different male clonal lines as well as in outcrosses involving outbred OSU and hybrids between the OSU line and the male clonal lines. The cytogenetic maps of the X and Y chromosomes were very similar to the female genetic map for the X chromosome. Five markers on the male maps are genetically very close to the sex determination locus (SEX), but more widely spaced on the female genetic map and on the cytogenetic map, indicating a large region of suppressed recombination on the Y chromosome surrounding the SEX locus. The male map is greatly extended at the telomere. A BAC clone containing the SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) Omy-163 marker, which maps close to SEX, was subjected to shotgun sequencing. Two carbonyl reductase genes and a gene homologous to the vertebrate skeletal ryanodine receptor were identified. Carbonyl reductase is a key enzyme involved in production of trout ovarian maturation hormone. This brings the number of type I genes mapped to the sex chromosome to six and has allowed us to identify a region on zebrafish chromosome 10 and medaka chromosome 13 which may be homologous to the distal portion of the long arm of the rainbow trout Y chromosome.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Most teleost species, especially freshwater groups such as the Esocidae which are the closest relatives of salmonids, have a karyotype comprising 25 pairs of acrocentric chromosomes and 48-52 chromosome arms. After the common ancestor of salmonids underwent a whole genome duplication, its karyotype would have 100 chromosome arms, and this is reflected in the modal range of 96-104 seen in extant salmonids (e.g., rainbow trout). The Atlantic salmon is an exception among the salmonids as it has 72-74 chromosome arms and its karyotype includes 12 pairs of large acrocentric chromosomes, which appear to be the result of tandem fusions. The purpose of this study was to integrate the Atlantic salmon's linkage map and karyotype and to compare the chromosome map with that of rainbow trout. RESULTS: The Atlantic salmon genetic linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes in the European subspecies using fluorescence in situ hybridization with BAC probes containing genetic markers mapped to each linkage group. The genetic linkage groups were larger for metacentric chromosomes compared to acrocentric chromosomes of similar size. Comparison of the Atlantic salmon chromosome map with that of rainbow trout provides strong evidence for conservation of large syntenic blocks in these species, corresponding to entire chromosome arms in the rainbow trout. CONCLUSION: It had been suggested that some of the large acrocentric chromosomes in Atlantic salmon are the result of tandem fusions, and that the small blocks of repetitive DNA in the middle of the arms represent the sites of chromosome fusions. The finding that the chromosomal regions on either side of the blocks of repetitive DNA within the larger acrocentric chromosomes correspond to different rainbow trout chromosome arms provides support for this hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The rainbow trout genetic linkage groups have been assigned to specific chromosomes in the OSU (2N=60) strain using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BAC probes containing genes mapped to each linkage group. There was a rough correlation between chromosome size and size of the genetic linkage map in centimorgans for the genetic maps based on recombination from the female parent. Chromosome size and structure have a major impact on the female:male recombination ratio, which is much higher (up to 10:1 near the centromeres) on the larger metacentric chromosomes compared to smaller acrocentric chromosomes. Eighty percent of the BAC clones containing duplicate genes mapped to a single chromosomal location, suggesting that diploidization resulted in substantial divergence of intergenic regions. The BAC clones that hybridized to both duplicate loci were usually located in the distal portion of the chromosome. Duplicate genes were almost always found at a similar location on the chromosome arm of two different chromosome pairs, suggesting that most of the chromosome rearrangements following tetraploidization were centric fusions and did not involve homeologous chromosomes. The set of BACs compiled for this research will be especially useful in construction of genome maps and identification of QTL for important traits in other salmonid fishes.},

In almost every case, the markers were found at approximately the same location on the chromosome arm in each species, suggesting conservation of marker order on the chromosome arms of the two species in most cases. Although theoretically a few centric fissions could convert the karyotype of rainbow trout (2N = 58-64) into that of Chinook salmon (2N = 68) or vice versa, our data suggest that chromosome arms underwent multiple centric fissions and subsequent new centric fusions to form the current karyotypes.

  Abstract                 = {One of the most unexpected discoveries in MHC genetics came from studies dealing with the teleost MHC. Initially discovered in zebrafish, the MHC class I and II regions of all bony fish are not linked. Previous segregation analysis in trout suggested that the class I and II regions reside on completely different chromosomes. To learn more about MHC genomics in trout, we have isolated BAC clones harboring class Ia and Ib loci, a single BAC clone containing an MH class II gene ( DAB), as well as BAC clones containing the ABCB2 gene. Upon PCR and sequence confirmation, BAC clones were labeled and used as probes for in situ hybridization on rainbow trout metaphase chromosomes for determination of the physical locations of the trout MH regions. Finally, SNPs, RFLPs, and microsatellites found within the BAC clones allowed for these regions to be assigned to specific linkage groups on the OSU x Hotcreek (HC) and OSU x Arlee (ARL) genetic linkage maps. Our data demonstrate that the trout MH regions are located on at least four different chromosomes and the corresponding linkage groups, while also providing direct evidence for the partial duplication of the MH class I region in trout.},

Two gynogenetic diploid families, each consisting of a female and 50 offspring, were genotyped at 56 microsatellite loci, including 30 loci developed in the present study and 26 loci reported in the previous study. Overall, 33 anonymous microsatellites derived from genomic library and 11 EST-linked microsatellites were mapped to their centromeres. High levels of chiasma interference were apparent in the walking catfish genome as indicated by an average frequency of second-division segregation (y) of 0.643 +/- 0.248. Twenty-six loci (59%) showed a high microsatellite-centromere recombination, with a frequency > 0.67, and three loci had recombination frequencies > 0.9.

  Abstract                 = {Some zebrafish genes appear to lack an ortholog in the human genome and researchers often call them "novel" genes. The origin of many so-called "novel" genes becomes apparent when considered in the context of genome duplication events that occurred during evolution of the phylum Chordata, including two rounds at about the origin of the subphylum Vertebrata (R1 and R2) and one round before the teleost radiation (R3). Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be "novel" are more appropriately interpreted as "ohnologs gone missing", cases in which ohnologs are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.},

We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life-history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admired individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  Abstract                 = {Characterization of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) field isolates from North America has established three main genogroups (U, M and L) that differ in host-specific virulence. In sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, the U genogroup is highly virulent, whereas the M genogroup is nearly non-pathogenic. In this study, we sought to characterize the virus-host dynamics that contribute to genogroup-specific virulence in a captive stock of sockeye salmon from Redfish Lake in Idaho. Juvenile sockeye salmon were challenged by immersion and injection with either a representative U or M viral strain and sampled periodically until 14 days post-infection (p.i.). Fish challenged with each strain had positive viral titre by day 3, regardless of challenge route, but the fish exposed to the M genogroup virus had significantly lower virus titres than fish exposed to the U genogroup virus. Gene expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was used to simultaneously assess viral load and host interferon (IFN) response in the anterior kidney. Viral load was significantly higher in the U-challenged fish relative to M-challenged fish. Both viruses induced expression of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), but expression was usually significantly lower in the M-challenged group, particularly at later time points (7 and 14 days p.i.). However, ISG expression was comparable with 3 days post-immersion challenge despite a significant difference in viral load. Our data indicated that the M genogroup virus entered the host, replicated and spread in the sockeye salmon tissues, but to a lesser extent than the U genogroup. Both virus types induced a host IFN response, but the high virulence strain (U) continued to replicate in the presence of this response, whereas the low virulence strain (M) was cleared below detectable levels. We hypothesize that high virulence is associated with early in vivo replication allowing the virus to achieve a threshold level, which the host innate immune system cannot control.},

  Abstract                 = {We are writing in response to the population and phylogenomics meeting review by Andrews & Luikart (2014) entitled 'Recent novel approaches for population genomics data analysis'. Restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing has become a powerful and useful approach in molecular ecology, with several different published methods now available to molecular ecologists, none of which can be considered the best option in all situations. A&L report that the original RAD protocol of Miller et al. (2007) and Baird et al. (2008) is superior to all other RAD variants because putative PCR duplicates can be identified (see Baxter et al. 2011), thereby reducing the impact of PCR artefacts on allele frequency estimates (Andrews & Luikart 2014). In response, we (i) challenge the assertion that the original RAD protocol minimizes the impact of PCR artefacts relative to that of other RAD protocols, (ii) present additional biases in RADseq that are at least as important as PCR artefacts in selecting a RAD protocol and (iii) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of four different approaches to RADseq which are a representative sample of all RAD variants: the original RAD protocol (mbRAD, Miller et al. 2007; Baird et al. 2008), double digest RAD (ddRAD, Peterson et al. 2012), ezRAD (Toonen et al. 2013) and 2bRAD (Wang et al. 2012). With an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different RAD protocols, researchers can make a more informed decision when selecting a RAD protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {Arctic charr is an especially attractive aquaculture species given that it features the desirable tissue traits of other salmonids and is bred and grown at inland freshwater tank farms year round. It is of interest to develop upper temperature tolerant (UTT) strains of Arctic charr to increase the robustness of the species in the face of climate change and to enable production in more southern regions. We used a genomics approach that takes advantage of the well-studied Atlantic salmon genome to identify genes that are associated with UTT in Arctic charr. Specifically, we conducted an acute temperature trial to identify temperature tolerant and intolerant Arctic charr individuals, which were subject to microarray and qPCR analysis to identify candidate UTT genes. These were compared with genes annotated in a quantitative trait locus (QTL) region that was previously identified as associated with UTT in rainbow trout and Arctic charr and that we sequenced in Atlantic salmon. Our results suggest that small heat shock proteins as well as HSP-90 genes are associated with UTT. Furthermore, hemoglobin expression was significantly downregulated in tolerant compared with intolerant fish. Finally, QTL analysis and expression profiling identified COUP-TFII as a candidate UTT gene, although its specific role is unclear given the identification of two transcripts, which appear to have different expression patterns. Our results highlight the importance of using more than one approach to identify candidate genes, particularly when examining a complicated trait such as UTT in a highly complex genome for which there is no reference genome.},

The progenies from several di-, tri- or tetra-allelic plants belong to the species M. sativa and M. falcata and their hybrids were studied for the segregation of the three genes. In all cases, tetrasomic inheritance of chromosomal-type segregation was observed. In another progeny resulting from the crossing of two plants involving four different alleles at locus Lap-2, tetrasomic segregation with the possible occurrence of double reduction was observed. This study presents direct evidence of autotetraploidy and the existence of tetra-allelic loci in alfalfa.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Current high-throughput sequencing technologies allow cost-efficient genotyping of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for hundreds of samples. However, the tools that are currently available for constructing linkage maps are not well suited for large datasets. Linkage maps of large datasets would be helpful in de novo genome assembly by facilitating comprehensive genome validation and refinement by enabling chimeric scaffold detection, as well as in family-based linkage and association studies, quantitative trait locus mapping, analysis of genome synteny and other complex genomic data analyses. RESULTS: We describe a novel tool, called Lepidoptera-MAP (Lep-MAP), for constructing accurate linkage maps with ultradense genome-wide SNP data. Lep-MAP is fast and memory efficient and largely automated, requiring minimal user interaction. It uses simultaneously data on multiple outbred families and can increase linkage map accuracy by taking into account achiasmatic meiosis, a special feature of Lepidoptera and some other taxa with no recombination in one sex (no recombination in females in Lepidoptera). We demonstrate that Lep-MAP outperforms other methods on real and simulated data. We construct a genome-wide linkage map of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) with over 40 000 SNPs. The data were generated with a novel in-house SOLiD restriction site-associated DNA tag sequencing protocol, which is described in the online supplementary material.

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing allows the discovery of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in species where little genomic information was previously available. Here, we assembled, de novo, over 130 mb of non-normalized cDNA using 454 pyrosequencing data from dwarf and normal lake whitefish and backcross hybrids. Our main goals were to gather a large data set of SNP markers, document their distribution within coding regions, evaluate the effect of species divergence on allele frequencies and combine results with previous genomic studies to identify candidate genes underlying the adaptive divergence of lake whitefish. We identified 6094 putative SNPs in 2674 contigs (mean size: 576 bp, range: 101-6116) and 1540 synonymous and 1734 non-synonymous mutations for a genome-wide non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (p(N)/p(S)) of 0.37. As expected based on the young age (<15 000 years) of whitefish species pair, the overall level of divergence between them was relatively weak. Yet, 89 SNPs showed pronounced allele frequency differences between sympatric normal and dwarf whitefish. Among these, SNPs in genes annotated to energy metabolic functions were the most abundant and this, in addition to previous experimental data at the gene expression and phenotypic level, brings compelling evidence that genes involved in energy metabolism are prime candidates explaining the adaptive divergence of lake whitefish species pairs. Finally, we unexpectedly identified 44 contigs annotated to transposable elements and these were predominantly composed of backcross hybrids sequences. This indicates an elevated activity of transposable elements, which could potentially contribute to the reduced fitness of hybrids previously documented.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Genetic maps characterizing the inheritance patterns of traits and markers have been developed for a wide range of species and used to study questions in biomedicine, agriculture, ecology and evolutionary biology. The status of rainbow trout genetic maps has progressed significantly over the last decade due to interest in this species in aquaculture and sport fisheries, and as a model research organism for studies related to carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. We constructed a second generation genetic map for rainbow trout using microsatellite markers to facilitate the identification of quantitative trait loci for traits affecting aquaculture production efficiency and the extraction of comparative information from the genome sequences of model fish species. RESULTS: A genetic map ordering 1124 microsatellite loci spanning a sex-averaged distance of 2927.10 cM (Kosambi) and having 2.6 cM resolution was constructed by genotyping 10 parents and 150 offspring from the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA) reference family mapping panel. Microsatellite markers, representing pairs of loci resulting from an evolutionarily recent whole genome duplication event, identified 180 duplicated regions within the rainbow trout genome. Microsatellites associated with genes through expressed sequence tags or bacterial artificial chromosomes produced comparative assignments with tetraodon, zebrafish, fugu, and medaka resulting in assignments of homology for 199 loci. CONCLUSION: The second generation NCCCWA genetic map provides an increased microsatellite marker density and quantifies differences in recombination rate between the sexes in outbred populations. It has the potential to integrate with cytogenetic and other physical maps, identifying paralogous regions of the rainbow trout genome arising from the evolutionarily recent genome duplication event, and anchoring a comparative map with the zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon, and fugu genomes. This resource will facilitate the identification of genes affecting traits of interest through fine mapping and positional cloning of candidate genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about the genetics controlling the rate of embryonic development in salmonids, despite the fact that this trait plays an important role in the life history of wild and cultured stocks. We investigated the genetics of embryonic development rate by performing an analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) on two families of androgenetically derived doubled haploid rainbow trout produced from a hybrid of two clonal lines with divergent embryonic development rates. A total of 170 doubled haploid individuals were genotyped at 222 marker loci [219 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 2 microsatellites, and p53]. A genetic linkage analysis resulted in a map consisting of 27 linkage groups with 21 of the markers remaining unlinked at a minimum LOD of 3.0 and maximum theta of 0.40. Eight of these linkage groups were matched to published rainbow trout linkage groups. Composite interval mapping (CIM) revealed evidence for two QTL influencing time to hatch, and suggestive evidence for a third. These QTL accounted for a total of 24.6% of the variation in time to hatch. One of these QTL had a large effect on development rate, especially in one family of doubled haploids, in which it explained 25.6% of the variance in time to hatch. QTL influencing embryonic length and weight at the commencement of exogenous feeding were also identified. The QTL with the strongest effect on embryonic length (lenR13) mapped to the same position as the QTL with the strongest effect on time to hatch (tthR13), suggesting a single QTL may have a pleiotropic effect on both these traits. These results suggest that the use of clonal lines with a doubled haploid crossing design is an effective way of analyzing the genetic basis of complex traits in salmonids.},

  Abstract                 = {The northern pike is the most frequently studied member of the Esociformes, the closest order to the diverse and economically important Salmoniformes. The ancestor of all salmonids purportedly experienced a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, making salmonid species ideal for studying the early impacts of genome duplication while complicating their use in wider analyses of teleost evolution. Studies suggest that the Esociformes diverged from the salmonid lineage prior to the WGD, supporting the use of northern pike as a pre-duplication outgroup. Here we present the first genome assembly, reference transcriptome and linkage map for northern pike, and evaluate the suitability of this species to provide a representative pre-duplication genome for future studies of salmonid and teleost evolution. The northern pike genome sequence is composed of 94,267 contigs (N50 = 16,909 bp) contained in 5,688 scaffolds (N50 = 700,535 bp); the total scaffolded genome size is 878 million bases. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that over 96% of the protein-coding genome is present in the genome assembly. The reference transcriptome was constructed from 13 tissues and contains 38,696 transcripts, which are accompanied by normalized expression data in all tissues. Gene-prediction analysis produced a total of 19,601 northern pike-specific gene models. The first-generation linkage map identifies 25 linkage groups, in agreement with northern pike's diploid karyotype of 2N = 50, and facilitates the placement of 46% of assembled bases onto linkage groups. Analyses reveal a high degree of conserved synteny between northern pike and other model teleost genomes. While conservation of gene order is limited to smaller syntenic blocks, the wider conservation of genome organization implies the northern pike exhibits a suitable approximation of a non-duplicated Protacanthopterygiian genome. This dataset will facilitate future studies of esocid biology and empower ongoing examinations of the Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout genomes by facilitating their comparison with other major teleost groups.

To that aim, I first provide results for values of F-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for F-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. Based on these results, I propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of FST/(1-FST) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. This regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. In two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods.},

In order for science to fulfill its potential in the arena of salmon recovery planning, several shortcomings of the science and its application to decision-making must be rectified. The definition of conservation units using genetic and phylogenetic inference needs to be sharpened. Ecological analyses must get beyond casting blame for past declines in salmon numbers and examine mixed strategies of management that consider interactions between hatcheries, harvest, hydropower, and habitat factors as well as background natural stresses and invasive species. Glib acceptance of expert opinion and extrapolated or inferred data should be tempered. To deal with uncertainty, recovery teams should engage in scenario analyses in which a wide variety of assumptions are played out. Finally, there is a pressing need for analyses aimed at determining what circumstances and communication strategies give science an effective voice in decision-making.},

  Abstract                 = {A whole-genome duplication occurred in a shared ancestor of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces castellii and Candida glabrata. Here we trace the subsequent losses of duplicated genes, and show that the pattern of loss differs among the three species at 20% of all loci. For example, several transcription factor genes, including STE12, TEC1, TUP1 and MCM1, are single-copy in S. cerevisiae but are retained in duplicate in S. castellii and C. glabrata. At many loci, different species have lost different members of a duplicated gene pair, so that 4-7% of single-copy genes compared between any two species are not orthologues. This pattern of gene loss provides strong evidence for speciation through a version of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller mechanism, in which the loss of alternative copies of duplicated genes leads to reproductive isolation. We show that the lineages leading to the three species diverged shortly after the whole-genome duplication, during a period of precipitous gene loss. The set of loci at which single-copy paralogues are retained is biased towards genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and genes that evolve slowly, consistent with the hypothesis that reciprocal gene loss is more likely to occur between duplicated genes that are functionally indistinguishable. We propose a simple, unified model in which a single mechanism--passive gene loss-enabled whole--genome duplication and led to the rapid emergence of new yeast species.},

Forecasts of climate impacts on ecosystems are far more challenging and their uncertainties even larger because of a limited understanding of physical controls on biological systems. Management and conservation plans that explicitly account for changing climate are rare and even those generally rely on retrospective analyses rather than future scenarios of climatic conditions and associated responses of specific ecosystems. Using past biophysical relationships as a guide to predicting the impacts of future climate change assumes that the observed relationships will remain constant. However, this assumption involves a long chain of uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gases, and the ecological consequences of climate change. These uncertainties in forecasting biological responses to changing climate highlight the need for resource management and conservation policies that are robust to unknowns and responsive to change. We Suggest how policy might develop despite substantial uncertainties about the future state of salmon ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Until recently, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in nonmodel organisms faced many challenges, often depending upon a targeted-gene approach and Sanger sequencing of many individuals. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has dramatically improved discovery, but validating and testing SNPs for use in population studies remain labour intensive. Here, we detail a SNP discovery and validation pipeline that incorporates 454 pyrosequencing, high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) and 5' nuclease genotyping. We generated 4.59x10(8) bp of redundant sequence from transcriptomes of two individual chum salmon, a highly valued species across the Pacific Rim. Nearly 26000 putative SNPs were identified--some as heterozygotes and some as homozygous for different nucleotides in the two individuals. For validation, we selected 202 templates containing single putative SNPs and conducted HRMA on 10 individuals from each of 19 populations from across the species range. Finally, 5' nuclease genotyping validated 37 SNPs that conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations. Putative SNPs expressed as heterozygotes in an ascertainment individual had more than twice the validation rate of those homozygous for different alleles in the two fish, suggesting that many of the latter may have been paralogous sequence variants. Overall, this validation rate of 37/202 suggests that we have found more than 4500 templates containing SNPs for use in this population set. We anticipate using this pipeline to significantly expand the number of SNPs available for the studies of population structure and mixture analyses as well as for the studies of adaptive genetic variation in nonmodel organisms.},

We also report the results from 39 pairwise examinations for joint segregation for 10 loci in nine testcross families. Only two loci assorted nonrandomly--either Aat1 or Aat2 with Gpt. Gene-centromere distances for Aat3 and Mpi differed significantly from those reported previously for rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), a closely related species. This difference indicates either the presence of chromosome rearrangements or a different rate of recombination between the species. These results contrast with the conservation of linkage distances previously reported within and between other salmonid genera.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of the oceanic and near-shore distributions of Pacific salmon, whose migrations typically span thousands of kilometres, have become increasingly valuable in the presence of climate change, increasing hatchery production and potentially high rates of bycatch in offshore fisheries. Genetics data offer considerable insights into both the migratory routes as well as the evolutionary histories of the species. However, these types of studies require extensive data sets from spawning populations originating from across the species' range. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been particularly amenable for multinational applications because they are easily shared, require little interlaboratory standardization and can be assayed through increasingly efficient technologies. Here, we discuss the development of a data set for 114 populations of chum salmon through a collaboration among North American and Asian researchers, termed PacSNP. PacSNP is focused on developing the database and applying it to problems of international interest. A data set spanning the entire range of species provides a unique opportunity to examine patterns of variability, and we review issues associated with SNP development. We found evidence of ascertainment bias within the data set, variable linkage relationships between SNPs associated with ancestral groupings and outlier loci with alleles associated with latitude.},

  Abstract                 = {Studying the effect of similar environments on diverse genetic backgrounds has long been a goal of evolutionary biologists with studies typically relying on experimental approaches. Pink salmon, a highly abundant and widely ranging salmonid, provide a naturally occurring opportunity to study the effects of similar environments on divergent genetic backgrounds due to a strict two-year semelparous life history. The species is composed of two reproductively isolated lineages with overlapping ranges that share the same spawning and rearing environments in alternate years. We used restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to discover and genotype approximately 8000 SNP loci in three population pairs of even- and odd-year pink salmon along a latitudinal gradient in North America. We found greater differentiation within the odd-year than within the even-year lineage and greater differentiation in the southern pair from Puget Sound than in the northern Alaskan population pairs. We identified 15 SNPs reflecting signatures of parallel selection using both a differentiation-based method (BAYESCAN) and an environmental correlation method (BAYENV). These SNPs represent genomic regions that may be particularly informative in understanding adaptive evolution in pink salmon and exploring how differing genetic backgrounds within a species respond to selection from the same natural environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Declines in populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. have been most pronounced in the southern extent of their range, and numerous anthropogenic stressors and natural drivers have been identified as potential causes. Using a paleolimnological approach, we have reconstructed the natural variability in the population dynamics of endangered Snake River sockeye salmon O. nerka over approximately the past 1,370 years. The rearing habitat ecology of their main production system, Redfish Lake, Idaho was also assessed over the past 500 years. Siliceous algal remains (diatoms and chrysophytes), stable nitrogen isotope delta N-15, cladoceran zooplankton subfossils, and other proxy indicators archived in dated lake sediment cores were employed in this analysis. The inferred natural salmon production was much higher than that recorded in fisheries escapement data. Unprecedented declines in Snake River sockeye salmon production and changes in rearing system ecology were inferred over the past 150 years. The early, negative influences of the Columbia River commercial salmon harvest (in the 1860s) and sustained interruption of migration access (1910-1934) from hydroelectric damming were evident. Enhanced zooplanktivory, associated with normative stocking and possible expansion of kokanee (lacustrine sockeye salmon) beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, appear to have altered the forage base for juvenile sockeye salmon, probably contributing to further declines. Lake nutrient enrichment since the 1950s was inferred, which changed nursery lake nutrient and trophic dynamics. This study highlights both site-specific and regional influences on declines in past Snake River sockeye salmon population abundance and changes in rearing system ecology for these fish over the past 150 years. Such a long-term ecological perspective is important to the continued conservation and management of this endangered species and has broader applications for other sockeye salmon runs at risk throughout their range.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy has been widely appreciated as an important force in the evolution of plant genomes, but now it is recognized as a common phenomenon throughout eukaryotic evolution. Insight into this process has been gained by analyzing the plant, animal, fungal, and recently protozoan genomes that show evidence of whole genome duplication (a transient doubling of the entire gene repertoire of an organism). Moreover, comparative analyses are revealing the evolutionary processes that occur as multiple related genomes diverge from a shared polyploid ancestor, and in individual genomes that underwent several successive rounds of duplication. Recent research including laboratory studies on synthetic polyploids indicates that genome content and gene expression can change quickly after whole genome duplication and that cross-genome regulatory interactions are important. We have a growing understanding of the relationship between whole genome duplication and speciation. Further, recent studies are providing insights into why some gene pairs survive in duplicate, whereas others do not.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of genotyping polyploids is extremely important for the creation of genetic maps and assembly of complex plant genomes. Despite its significance, polyploid genotyping still remains largely unsolved and suffers from a lack of statistical formality. In this paper a graphical bayesian model for SNP genotyping data is introduced. This model can infer genotypes even when the ploidy of the population is unknown. We also introduce an algorithm for finding the exact maximum a posteriori genotype configuration with this model. This algorithm is implemented in a freely available web-based software package SuperMASSA. We demonstrate the utility, efficiency, and flexibility of the model and algorithm by applying them to two different platforms, each of which is applied to a polyploid data set: Illumina GoldenGate data from potato and Sequenom MassARRAY data from sugarcane. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both data sets and can be trivially adapted to use models that utilize prior information about any platform or species.},

To compare the relative recombination rates during meiosis in male and female zebrafish, we constructed a genetic map based on male meiosis. We developed a meiotic mapping panel of 94 androgenetic haploid embryos that were scored for genetic polymorphisms. The resulting male map was compared to female and sex-average maps. We found that the recombination rate in male meiosis is dramatically suppressed relative to that of female meiosis, especially near the centromere. These findings have practical applications for experimental design. The use of exclusively female meiosis in a positional cloning project maximizes the ratio of genetic map distance to physical distance. Alternatively, the use of exclusively male meiosis to localize a mutation initially to a linkage group or to maintain relationships of linked alleles minimizes recombination, thereby facilitating some types of analysis.},

As a result, it is possible to construct genetic linkage maps of these study populations by examining the co-segregation of markers through the pedigree. There are now four free-living vertebrate study populations for whom linkage maps have been built. In this study, simulation was used to investigate whether these linkage maps are likely to be accurate. In all four populations, the probability of assigning markers to the correct chromosome is high and framework maps are generally inferred correctly. However, genotyping error can result in incorrect maps being built with very strong statistical support over the correct order. Future applications of linkage maps of natural populations are discussed.},

The advent of next-generation sequencing and high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms means that mapping studies are set to become widespread in those wild populations for whom appropriate phenotypic data and DNA samples are available.

These programs require monitoring to determine their demographic, biological, and genetic effects. In 1990s in Washington State, the Summer Chum Salmon Conservation Initiative developed a recovery program for the threatened Hood Canal summer chum salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) (the metapopulation) that used in-river spawners (wild fish) for each respective supplementation broodstock in six tributaries. Returning spawners (wild-born and hatchery-born) composed subsequent broodstocks, and tributary-specific supplementation was limited to three generations. We assessed impacts of the programs on neutral genetic diversity in this metapopulation using 16 microsatellite loci and a thirty-year dataset spanning before and after supplementation, roughly eight generations. Following supplementation, differentiation among subpopulations decreased (but not significantly) and isolation by distance patterns remained unchanged. There was no decline in genetic diversity in wild-born fish, but hatchery-born fish sampled in the same spawning areas had significantly lower genetic diversity and unequal family representation. Despite potential for negative effects from supplementation programs, few were detected in wild-born fish. We hypothesize that chum salmon natural history makes them less vulnerable to negative impacts from hatchery supplementation.},

  Abstract                 = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a class of genetic markers that are well suited to a broad range of research and management applications. Although advances in genotyping chemistries and analysis methods continue to increase the potential advantages of using SNPs to address molecular ecological questions, the scarcity of available DNA sequence data for most species has limited marker development. As the number and diversity of species being targeted for large-scale sequencing has increased, so has the potential for using sequence from sister taxa for marker development in species of interest. We evaluated the use of Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo salar sequence data to identify SNPs in three other species (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Oncorhynchus nerka and Oncorhynchus keta). Primers designed based on O. mykiss and S. salar alignments were more successful than primers designed based on Oncorhynchus-only alignments for sequencing target species, presumably due to the much larger number of potential targets available from the former alignments and possibly greater sequence conservation in those targets. In sequencing approximately 89 kb we observed a frequency of 4.30 x 10(-3) SNPs per base pair. Approximately half (53/101) of the subsequently designed validation assays resulted in high-throughput SNP genotyping markers. We speculate that this relatively low conversion rate may reflect the duplicated nature of the salmon genome. Our results suggest that a large number of SNPs could be developed for Pacific salmon using sequence data from other species. While the costs of DNA sequencing are still significant, these must be compared to the costs of using other marker classes for a given application.},

Extant STR baselines for salmon Oncorhynchus spp. contain hundreds, of alleles, and it has been estimated that hundreds of SNP markers will need to be developed before the SNP baselines will be comparable to the STR baselines. We compared 15 STRs exhibiting 349 independent alleles with 61 SNPs exhibiting 66 independent alleles for accuracy in assigning individuals to closely related populations of chum salmon O. keta. The SNP baseline yielded slightly higher mean accuracies for proportional assignment and comparable accuracies for individual assignment. Based on the number of independent alleles in each baseline, the SNP baseline performed considerably better than the STR baseline. We suggest that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the simulation studies do not capture the impacts of the different strategies commonly employed for discovering and selecting STR and SNP markers.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy has long been recognized as a major force in angiosperm evolution. Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest several ancient genome-doubling events. These include ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no longer "What proportion of angiosperms are polyploid?", but "How many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given lineage?" New algorithms provide promise that ancestral genomes can be reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even the ancestral angiosperm genome). Comparisons of diversification rates suggest that genome doubling may have led to a dramatic increase in species richness in several angiosperm lineages, including Poaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae. However, additional genomic studies are needed to pinpoint the exact phylogenetic placement of the ancient polyploidy events within these lineages and to determine when novel genes resulting from polyploidy have enabled adaptive radiations.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy has played a major role in the evolution of many eukaryotes. Recent studies have dramatically reshaped views of polyploid evolution, demonstrating that most polyploid species examined, both plant and animal, have formed recurrently from different populations of their progenitors. Populations of independent origin can subsequently come into contact and hybridize, generating new genotypes. Because of the frequency of polyploidy in plants, many recognized species are probably polyphyletic. Extensive and rapid genome restructuring can occur after polyploidization. Such changes can be mediated by transposons. Polyploidization could represent a period of transilience, during which genomic changes occur, potentially producing new gene complexes and facilitating rapid evolution.},

We detected a length polymorphism in a growth hormone gene (GH-2) intron that is caused by an 81 bp insertion homologous to the 3' end of the salmonid short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) SmaI. Such insertion polymorphisms within species bring into question the use of SINEs as phylogenetic markers. We confirmed that a microsatellite locus encodes a PCR-null allele that is responsible for an apparent deficit of heterozygotes in a population sample from Prince William Sound. Another set of microsatellite primers amplified alleles of the same molecular weight from both loci of a duplicated pair. In our analysis of several PCR-based multilocus techniques, we failed to detect evidence of comigrating fragments produced by duplicated loci. Segregation analysis of PCR-based markers using gynogenetic haploid embryos ensures that the interpretation of molecular variation is not complicated by heterozygosity, diploidy, or gene duplication. We urge investigators to test the inheritance of polymorphisms in salmonids prior to using them to measure genetic variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Tetraploid inheritance has two extremes: disomic in allotetraploids and tetrasomic in autotetraploids. The possibility of mixed, or intermediate, inheritance models has generally been neglected. These could well apply to newly formed hybrids or to diploidizing (auto)tetraploids. We present a simple likelihood-based approach that is able to incorporate disomic, tetrasomic, and intermediate inheritance models and estimates the double-reduction rate. Our model shows that inheritance of microsatellite markers in natural tetraploids of Rorippa amphibia and R. sylvestris is tetrasomic, confirming their autotetraploid origin. However, in F(1) hybrids inheritance was intermediate to disomic and tetrasomic inheritance. Apparently, in meiosis, chromosomes paired preferentially with the homolog from the same parental species, but not strictly so. Detected double-reduction rates were low. We tested the general applicability of our model, using published segregation data. In two cases, an intermediate inheritance model gave a better fit to the data than the tetrasomic model advocated by the authors. The existence of inheritance intermediate to disomic and tetrasomic has important implications for linkage mapping and population genetics and hence breeding programs of tetraploids. Methods that have been developed for either disomic or tetrasomic tetraploids may not be generally applicable, particularly in systems where hybridization is common.},

  Abstract                 = {Backcrosses of clonal rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were used in an effort for fine-mapping of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for rapid embryonic development rate (tth-1). A previously identified QTL was backcrossed for two successive generations from the Clearwater (fast developing) line into the Oregon State University (OSU) (slow developing) background. Microsatellites tightly linked to the QTL and each other were used to genotype individuals in both backcrosses. An association was found between the microsatellites and gamete production in the first backcross and precocious gamete production in the second backcross generation. These results suggest that a region near the QTL-linked microsatellites may influence early sexual maturity, as well as development rate. Two gynogenetic families were produced using individuals from the first backcross (BC1). These crosses were screened with the tth-1 linked microsatellites and time to hatch was quantified. The Clearwater genotype was associated with early time to hatch, while the OSU genotype was associated with late hatching. Genotypic variation at these microsatellite loci explained 28% and 26% of the variation in time to hatch. Heterozygote frequencies for the microsatellites in the two gynogenetic families were 0.0088 and 0.01, suggesting that the QTL is near the centromere. Fine-mapping was limited due to the low level of recombination observed on this linkage group in the gynogenetic families. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Gene-centromere map distances, calculated under the assumption of complete interference, range from 1.1 cM for Ldh4 to 50 cM for Sod1. The Idh2 and Est1 loci are linked on the same chromosome arm.-The observation of close to 100% heterozygous gynogenetic diploids for the Sod1 and Mdh3,4 loci suggests that near-complete interference occurs on the chromosome arms carrying these loci. The high interference observed in this study and in several other species of fish may be related to the small size of fish chromosome arms.-Comparisons of map locations for the Ldh3 and Ldh4 and the Mdh3 and Mdh4 loci, which were duplicated by a tetraploid event in the evolution of salmonid fish, reveal that they are located at similar distances from their centromeres. Comparative mapping of loci duplicated longer ago shows more variation in map location.-The high proportion of heterozygotes for some loci after gynogenesis involving second polar body retention demonstrates that this is not a practical method for producing homozygous inbred lines in rainbow trout; treatments suppressing the first cell division are more promising for this purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is one of the most widely studied of model fish species. Extensive basic biological information has been collected for this species, which because of their large size relative to other model fish species are particularly suitable for studies requiring ample quantities of specific cells and tissue types. Rainbow trout have been widely utilized for research in carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. They are distinctive in having evolved from a relatively recent tetraploid event, resulting in a high incidence of duplicated genes. Natural populations are available and have been well characterized for chromosomal, protein, molecular and quantitative genetic variation. Their ease of culture, and experimental and aquacultural significance has led to the development of clonal lines and the widespread application of transgenic technology to this species. Numerous microsatellites have been isolated and two relatively detailed genetic maps have been developed. Extensive sequencing of expressed sequence tags has begun and four BAC libraries have been developed. The development and analysis of additional genomic sequence data will provide distinctive opportunities to address problems in areas such as evolution of the immune system and duplicate genes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Salmonids are regarded as 4R derivative species, having experienced 4 whole genome duplication events in their ancestry. Many duplicated chromosome regions still share extensive homology with one another which is maintained primarily through male-based homeologous chromosome pairings during meiosis. The formation of quadrivalents during meiosis leads to pseudolinkage. This phenomenon is more prevalent within 5 of the 12 ancestral teleost linkage groups in salmonids. RESULTS: We constructed a genetic linkage map for brook charr and used this in combination with the genetic map from Arctic charr, to make comparisons with the genetic map of rainbow trout. Although not all chromosome arms are currently mapped, some homologous chromosome rearrangements were evident between Arctic charr and brook charr. Notably, 10 chromosome arms in brook charr representing 5 metacentric chromosomes in Arctic charr have undergone rearrangements. Three metacentrics have one arm translocated and fused with another chromosome arm in brook charr to a make a new metacentrics while two metacentrics are represented by 4 acrocentric pairs in brook charr. In two cases (i.e., BC-4 and BC-16), an apparent polymorphism was observed with the identification of both a putative metacentric structure (similar to metacentric AC-4 = BC-4 and a joining of acrocentric AC-16 + one arm of AC-28 = BC-16), as well as two separate acrocentric linkage groups evident in the mapping parents. Forty-six of the expected 50 karyotypic arms could be inter-generically assigned. SEX in brook charr (BC-4) was localized to the same homologous linkage group region as in Arctic charr (AC-4). The homeologous affinities detected in the two charr species facilitated the identification of 20 (expected number = 25) shared syntenic regions with rainbow trout, although it is likely that some of these regions were partial or overlapping arm regions. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-generic comparisons among 2 species of charr (genus Salvelinus) and a trout (genus Oncorhynchus) have identified that linkage group arm arrangements are largely retained among these species. Previous studies have revealed that up to 7 regions of high duplicate marker retention occur between Salmo species (i.e., Atlantic salmon and brown trout) and rainbow trout, with 5 of these regions exhibiting higher levels of pseudolinkage. Pseudolinkage was detected in the charr species (i.e., BC-1/21, AC-12/27, AC-6/23, = RT-2p/29q, RT-12p/16p, and RT-27p/31p, respectively) consistent with three of the five 'salmonid-specific' pseudolinkage regions. Chromosome arms with the highest number of duplicated markers in rainbow trout are the linkage group arms with the highest retention of duplicated markers in both charr species.},

  Abstract                 = {Tetraploid individuals of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L. subsp. hispanica Roth.) sampled from a natural population were used to evaluate the correlation between both single and multilocus heterozygosity at 7 enzyme loci, and several quantitative traits (plant size at time of collection, leaf weight, and panicle number in experimental trials). Four hundred and forty-eight plants were studied at the 7 loci and 288 of these individuals were scored for an additional eighth locus. Five genotype classes (monogenic, simplex, and duplex digenic, trigenic, and tetragenic) were distinguished according to their heterozygosity level. Multilocus heterozygosity showed a significant positive correlation with both leaf and panicle yield in experimental conditions, but not with original plant size, which was found to be markedly influenced by environmental microheterogeneity. Multilocus heterozygosity, estimated from both the number of heterozygous loci and the number of distinct alleles per locus, had a significant influence on plant performance. Individual locus effects were positive and significant at two loci (GOT1 and PX1). Panicle number increased regularly with heterozygosity level (from monogenics to tetragenics) at the GOT1 locus, as did leaf weight and panicle number at the PX1 locus. Such variation would be predicted by overdominance at these loci or at linked loci. Significant relationships between leaf yield and heterozygosity level at the GOT1 locus distinguished the homozygotes from the heterozygotes (of any class) and was thus more consistent with inbreeding effects. No significant differences were observed among the five genotype classes for any quantitative trait at the six remaining loci. At both the GOT1 and PX1 loci, heterozygosity had a significant independent effect on leaf weight and panicle number even when the correlation between these traits was removed by analysis of covariance.},

  Abstract                 = {Scaling models of random N x N hermitian matrices and passing to the limit N --> infinity leads to integral operators whose Fredholm determinants describe the statistics of the spacing of the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices of large order. For the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, and for many others as well, the kernel one obtains by scaling in the ''bulk'' of the spectrum is the ''sine kernel'' sin pi(x-y)/pi(x-y). Rescaling the GUE at the ''edge'' of the spectrum leads to the kernel Ai(x)Ai'(y)-Ai'(x)Ai(y)/x-y , where Ai is the Airy function. In previous work we found several analogies between properties of this ''Airy kernel'' and known properties of the sine kernel: a system of partial differential equations associated with the logarithmic differential of the Fredholm determinant when the underlying domain is a union of intervals; a representation of the Fredholm determinant in terms of a Painleve transcendent in the case of a single interval; and, also in this case, asymptotic expansions for these determinants and related quantities, achieved with the help of a differential operator which commutes with the integral operator. In this paper we show that there are completely analogous properties for a class of kernels which arise when one rescales the Laguerre or Jacobi ensembles at the edge of the spectrum, namely J(alpha)(square-root x) square-root yJ(alpha)'(square-root y) - square-root x J(alpha)'(square-root x) J(alpha) (square-root y)/2(x - y) where J(alpha)(z) is the Bessel function of order alpha. In the cases alpha = -/+ 1/2 these become, after a variable change, the kernels which arise when taking scaling limits in the bulk of the spectrum for the Gaussian orthogonal and symplectic ensembles. In particular, an asymptotic expansion we derive will generalize ones found by Dyson for the Fredholm determinants of these kernels.},

  Abstract                 = {Autopolyploid taxa present numerous challenges for population genetic analyses due to difficulties determining allele dosage. Dosage ambiguity hinders accurate assessment of allele frequencies, multilocus genotypes (MLGTs), as well as levels and patterns of clonality. The pervasiveness of polyploidy in the evolutionary history of plant taxa makes this a recurring problem. Whereas diploidization of loci may occur over time, duplication of at least some loci is still frequently evident. Fortunately, with high-quality allozyme gels, it is possible to accurately infer allele dosage and, thus, determine exact MLGTs. However, accurately assessing dosage of microsatellite peaks is nearly impossible when studying wild populations with a large number of alleles per locus. Even if precise knowledge of genotypes is not required, for comparable numbers of alleles per locus and loci, the number of "phenotypes" is always lower with microsatellites than allozymes due to the inability to assess allele dosage. Microsatellite loci typically have more alleles per locus relative to allozymes although fewer loci are generally employed. Here, we present a mathematical model for comparing the relative utility of simple sequence repeat (SSR) versus allozyme markers to discriminate MLGTs. For example, the average plant allozyme study (2.6 alleles per locus, 10 polymorphic loci) has better discriminating power than SSR markers with 10 alleles at each of 3 loci, 9 alleles at 4 loci, 6 alleles at 5 loci, 5 alleles at 6 loci, and 4 alleles at 8 loci, demonstrating the value of assessing the relative discriminating power of these markers.},

  Abstract                 = {How natural climate cycles, such as past glacial/interglacial patterns, have shaped species distributions at the high-latitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere is still largely unclear. Here, we show how the post-glacial warming following the Last Glacial Maximum (ca 18 000 years ago), allowed the (re) colonization of the fragmented sub-Antarctic habitat by an upper-level marine predator, the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus. Using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing and standard mitochondrial data, we tested the behaviour of subsets of anonymous nuclear loci in inferring past demography through coalescent-based and allele frequency spectrum analyses. Our results show that the king penguin population breeding on Crozet archipelago steeply increased in size, closely following the Holocene warming recorded in the Epica Dome C ice core. The following population growth can be explained by a threshold model in which the ecological requirements of this species (year-round ice-free habitat for breeding and access to a major source of food such as the Antarctic Polar Front) were met on Crozet soon after the Pleistocene/Holocene climatic transition.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred twice during the evolutionary process of vertebrates around 450 and 500 million years ago, which contributed to an increase in the genomic and phenotypic complexities of vertebrates. However, little is still known about the evolutionary process of homoeologous chromosomes after WGD because many duplicate genes have been lost. Therefore, Xenopus laevis (2n=36) and Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis (2n=20) are good animal models for studying the process of genomic and chromosomal reorganization after WGD because X. laevis is an allotetraploid species that resulted from WGD after the interspecific hybridization of diploid species closely related to X. tropicalis. We constructed a comparative cytogenetic map of X. laevis using 60 complimentary DNA clones that covered the entire chromosomal regions of 10 pairs of X. tropicalis chromosomes. We consequently identified all nine homoeologous chromosome groups of X. laevis. Hybridization signals on two pairs of X. laevis homoeologous chromosomes were detected for 50 of 60 (83%) genes, and the genetic linkage is highly conserved between X. tropicalis and X. laevis chromosomes except for one fusion and one inversion and also between X. laevis homoeologous chromosomes except for two inversions. These results indicate that the loss of duplicated genes and inter- and/or intrachromosomal rearrangements occurred much less frequently in this lineage, suggesting that these events were not essential for diploidization of the allotetraploid genome in X. laevis after WGD.},

  Abstract                 = {As a first step toward the genetic mapping of QTL affecting stress response variation in rainbow trout, we performed complex segregation analyses (CSA) fitting mixed inheritance models of plasma cortisol by using Bayesian methods in large full-sib families of rainbow trout. To date, no studies have been conducted to determine the mode of inheritance of stress response as measured by plasma cortisol response when using a crowding stress paradigm and CSA in rainbow trout. The main objective of this study was to determine the mode of inheritance of plasma cortisol after a crowding stress. The results from fitting mixed inheritance models with Bayesian CSA suggest that 1 or more major genes with dominant cortisol-decreasing alleles and small additive genetic effects of a large number of independent genes likely underlie the genetic variation of plasma cortisol in the rainbow trout families evaluated. Plasma cortisol is genetically determined, with heritabilities of 0.22 to 0.39. Furthermore, a major gene with an additive effect of -42 ng/mL (approximately 1.0 genetic SD) is segregating in this rainbow trout broodstock population. These findings provide a basis for designing and executing genome-wide linkage studies to identify QTL for stress response in rainbow trout broodstock and markers for selective breeding.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Automated genotype calling in tetraploid species was until recently not possible, which hampered genetic analysis. Modern genotyping assays often produce two signals, one for each allele of a bi-allelic marker. While ample software is available to obtain genotypes (homozygous for either allele, or heterozygous) for diploid species from these signals, such software is not available for tetraploid species which may be scored as five alternative genotypes (aaaa, baaa, bbaa, bbba and bbbb; nulliplex to quadruplex). RESULTS: We present a novel algorithm, implemented in the R package fitTetra, to assign genotypes for bi-allelic markers to tetraploid samples from genotyping assays that produce intensity signals for both alleles. The algorithm is based on the fitting of several mixture models with five components, one for each of the five possible genotypes. The models have different numbers of parameters specifying the relation between the five component means, and some of them impose a constraint on the mixing proportions to conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) ratios. The software rejects markers that do not allow a reliable genotyping for the majority of the samples, and it assigns a missing score to samples that cannot be scored into one of the five possible genotypes with sufficient confidence. CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the software with data of a collection of 224 potato varieties assayed with an Illumina GoldenGate 384 SNP array and shown that all SNPs with informative ratio distributions are fitted. Almost all fitted models appear to be correct based on visual inspection and comparison with diploid samples. When the collection of potato varieties is analyzed as if it were a population, almost all markers seem to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

  Abstract                 = {The caudal fin represents a fundamental design feature of fishes and plays an important role in locomotor dynamics in fishes. The shape of caudal is an important parameter in traditional systematics. However, little is known about genes involved in the development of different forms of caudal fins. This study was conducted to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the length of caudal fin and the ratio between tail length and standard body length in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). One F1 family containing 380 offspring was generated by crossing two unrelated individuals. One hundred and seventeen microsatellites almost evenly distributed along the whole genome were genotyped. Length of caudal fin at 90 days post-hatch was measured. QTL analysis detected six significant (genome-wide significant) and two suggestive (linkage-group-wide significant) QTL on seven linkage groups. The six significant QTL explained 5.5-16.6% of the phenotypic variance, suggesting these traits were controlled by multiple genes. Comparative genomics analysis identified several potential candidate genes for the length of caudal fin. The QTL for the length of caudal fin detected for the first time in marine fish may provide a starting point for the future identification of genes involved in the development of different forms of caudal fins in fishes.},

  Abstract                 = {Many plants and some animal species are polyploids. Nondisomically inherited markers (e.g. microsatellites) in such species cannot be analysed directly by standard population genetics methods developed for diploid species. One solution is to transform the polyploid codominant genotypes to pseudodiploid-dominant genotypes, which can then be analysed by standard methods for various purposes such as spatial genetic structure, individual relatedness and relationship. Although this data transformation approach has been used repeatedly in the literature, no systematic study has been conducted to investigate how efficient it is, how much marker information is lost and thus how much analysis accuracy is reduced. More specifically, it is unknown whether or not the transformed data can be used to infer parentage and sibship jointly, and how different sampling schemes (number and polymorphism of markers, number of individuals) and ploidy level affect the inference accuracy. This study analyses both simulated and empirical data to examine the effects of polyploid levels, actual pedigree structures and marker number and polymorphism on the accuracy of joint parentage and sibship assignments in polyploid species. We show that sibship, parentage and selfing rates in polyploids can be inferred accurately from a typical set of microsatellite loci. We also show that inferences can be substantially improved by allowing for a small genotyping error rate to accommodate the distortion in assumed Mendelian inheritance of the converted markers when large sibship groups are involved. The results are discussed in the context of polyploid data analysis in molecular ecology.},

The extent of gene loss (fractionation) among triplicated genome segments varies, with one of the three copies consistently retaining a disproportionately large fraction of the genes expected to have been present in its ancestor. Variation in the number of members of gene families present in the genome may contribute to the remarkable morphological plasticity of Brassica species.

We present a maximum-likelihood-based method to resolve confounded paralogous loci by observing the segregation of alleles in gynogenetic haploid offspring and demonstrate its effectiveness by constructing two linkage maps for chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), with and without these newly resolved loci. We find that the resolved paralogous loci are not randomly distributed across the genome. A majority are clustered in expanded subtelomeric regions of 14 linkage groups, suggesting a significant fraction of the chum salmon genome may be missed by the exclusion of paralogous loci. Transposable elements have been proposed as drivers of genome evolution and, in salmonids, may have an important role in the rediploidization process by driving differentiation between homeologous chromosomes. Consistent with that hypothesis, we find a reduced fraction of transposable element annotations among paralogous loci, and these loci predominately occur in the genomic regions that lag in the rediploidization process.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic methods are routinely used to estimate contemporary effective population size (N e) in natural populations, but the vast majority of applications have used only the temporal (two-sample) method. We use simulated data to evaluate how highly polymorphic molecular markers affect precision and bias in the single-sample method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low-frequency alleles upwardly bias [Formula: see text], but a simple rule can reduce bias to <about 10% without sacrificing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10-20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (N e < 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With 'microsatellite' data, the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method, unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about N e in nature by wider use of single-sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Freshwater and early marine migration and survival of endangered Cultus Lake sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon were studied using the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) array. Smolts were acoustically tagged in 2004-2007, and their migration was recorded within the lower Fraser River and coastal southern British Columbia waters. Most smolts showed rapid directional movement (swimming speeds of similar to 15-30 km.day(-1)). Average exit time from the Fraser River was 4.0-5.6 days after release, and average residence time within the Strait of Georgia was 25.6-34.1 days. Most individuals migrated northward, generally close to the mainland coast. Survival rates, assessed using standard mark-recapture methods, were generally high during the downstream migration (50%-70%), except in 2005 when survival was <20%, possibly because of a late release. Marine survival rates were stable among years, between 10%-30% at a subarray sited 500 km away from the release site. Movement rates were similar to those of previously published work, but the POST array provided direct measurements of movement and estimates of survival and demonstrated the feasibility of establishing continental-scale acoustic arrays for management and conservation of marine species.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the evolutionary history and speculate about the evolutionary future of three basic life history ecotypes that contribute to the biocomplexity of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The 'recurrent evolution' (RE) hypothesis claims that the sea/river ecotype is ancestral, a 'straying' form with poorly differentiated (meta)population structure, and that highly structured populations of lake-type sockeye and kokanee have evolved repeatedly in parallel adaptive radiations between recurrent glaciations of the Pleistocene Epoch. Basic premises of this hypothesis are consistent with new, independent evidence from recent surveys of genetic variation in mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA: (1) sockeye salmon are most closely related to pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon with sea-type life histories; (2) the sockeye life history ecotypes exist as polyphyletic lineages within large drainages and geographic regions; (3) the sea/river ecotype exhibits less genetic differentiation among populations than the lake or kokanee ecotypes both within and among drainages; and (4) genetic diversity is typically higher in the sea/river ecotype than in the lake and kokanee ecotypes. Anthropogenic modification of estuarine habitat and intensive coastal fisheries have likely reduced and fragmented historic metapopulations of the sea/river ecotype, particularly in southern areas. In contrast, the kokanee ecotype appears to be favoured by marine fisheries and predicted changes in climate.},

  Abstract                 = {We constructed a genetic linkage map for Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) using two backcrosses between genetically divergent strains. Forty-six linkage groups (expected = 39-41) and 19 homeologous affinities (expected = 25) were identified using 184 microsatellites, 129 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), 13 type I gene markers, and one phenotypic marker, SEX. Twenty-six markers remain unlinked. Female map distance (9.92 Morgans) was substantially higher than male map distance (3.90 Morgans) based on the most complete parental information (i.e., the F1 hybrids). Female recombination rates were often significantly higher than those of males across all pairwise comparisons within homologous chromosomal segments (average female to male ratios within families was 1.69:1). The female hybrid parent had significantly higher recombination rates than the pure strain female parent. Segregation distortion was detected in four linkage groups (4, 8, 13, 20) for both families. In family 3, only the largest fish were sampled for genotyping, suggesting that segregation distortion may represent regions possessing influences on growth. In family 2, almost all cases showing segregation distortion involved markers in the female hybrid parent.},

Simulation results showed that the IN method outperformed, or at least was comparable to, the other three methods. These algorithms were also applied to a real data set and results showed that the linkage order obtained by the IN algorithm was superior to the other methods.

  Abstract                 = {In multivalent polyploids, simultaneous pairings among homologous chromosomes at meiosis result in a unique cytological phenomenon-double reduction. Double reduction casts an impact on chromosome evolution in higher plants, but because of its confounded effect on the pattern of gene cosegregation, it complicates linkage analysis and map construction with polymorphic molecular markers. In this article, we have proposed a general statistical model for simultaneously estimating the frequencies of double reduction, the recombination fraction, and optimal parental linkage phases between any types of markers, both fully and partially informative, or dominant and codominant, for a tetraploid species that undergoes only multivalent pairing. This model provides an in-depth extension of our earlier linkage model that was built upon Fisher's classifications for different gamete formation modes during the polysomic inheritance of a multivalent polyploid. By implementing a two-stage hierarchical EM algorithm, we derived a closed-form solution for estimating the frequencies of double reduction through the estimation of gamete mode frequencies and the recombination fraction. We performed different settings of simulation studies to demonstrate the statistical properties of our model for estimating and testing double reduction and the linkage in multivalent tetraploids. As shown by a comparative analysis, our model provides a general framework that covers existing statistical approaches for linkage mapping in polyploids that are predominantly multivalent. The model will have great implications for understanding the genome structure and organization of polyploid species.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on how chromosomes pair at meiosis, the nature of polyploids can be described by bivalent polyploids, multivalent polyploids, and mixed polyploids. In bivalent polyploids, only two chromosomes pair, during which two more similar chromosomes have a higher pairing probability (preferential pairing) than two less similar chromosomes, whereas in multivalent polyploids more than two chromosomes pair at a time, which results in double reduction. Preferential chromosome pairings and double reduction affect the frequencies of gamete formation and, therefore, linkage analysis of polymorphic markers in bivalent and multivalent polyploids, respectively. For mixed polyploids, in which both bivalent and multivalent formations occur simultaneously, linkage analysis is affected by both preferential pairings and double reduction. In this study, we develop a hierarchical maximum likelihood model for discerning gamete genotypes derived from different pairing mechanisms and different formation modes. The first-stage model in the hierarchy is formulated to characterize the relative frequencies of bivalent and multivalent pairing configurations in terms of the preferential pairing factor. The second-stage model is derived to rule out identical gamete genotypes into their different formation modes with relative probabilities determined by the recombination fraction. The first-stage pairing mechanism and second-stage formation mode are integrated to provide the simultaneous maximum likelihood estimates of the preferential pairing factor, the frequency of double reduction, and the recombination fraction, by implementing the EM algorithm. We performed extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the statistical properties of our hierarchical model for linkage analysis in tetraploids. The implications of our model for polyploid linkage mapping are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of new molecular marker technologies, it is now feasible to initiate genome projects for outcrossing plant species, which have not received much attention in genetic research, despite their great agricultural and environmental value. Because outcrossing species typically have heterogeneous genomes, data structure for molecular markers representing an entire genome is complex: some markers may have more alleles than others, some markers are codominant whereas others are dominant, and some markers are heterozygous in one parent but fixed in the other parent whereas the opposite can be true for other markers. A major difficulty in analyzing these different types of marker at the same time arises from uncertainty about parental linkage phases over markers. In this paper, we present a general maximum-likelihood-based algorithm for simultaneously estimating linkage and linkage phases for a mixed set of different marker types containing fully informative markers (segregating 1:1:1:1) and partially informative markers (or missing markers, segregating 1:2:1, 3:1, and 1:1) in a full-sib family derived from two outbred parent plants. The characterization of linkage phases is based on the posterior probability distribution of the assignment of alternative alleles at given markers to two homologous chromosomes of each parent, conditional on the observed phenotypes of the markers. Two- and multi-point analyses are performed to estimate the recombination fraction and determine the most likely linkage phase between different types of markers. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the statistical properties of the model for characterizing the linkage phase between markers.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic linkage maps are cornerstones of a wide spectrum of biotechnology applications, including map-assisted breeding, association genetics, and map-assisted gene cloning. During the past several years, the adoption of high-throughput genotyping technologies has been paralleled by a substantial increase in the density and diversity of genetic markers. New genetic mapping algorithms are needed in order to efficiently process these large datasets and accurately construct high-density genetic maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to order markers on a genetic linkage map. Our method is based on a simple yet fundamental mathematical property that we prove under rather general assumptions. The validity of this property allows one to determine efficiently the correct order of markers by computing the minimum spanning tree of an associated graph. Our empirical studies obtained on genotyping data for three mapping populations of barley (Hordeum vulgare), as well as extensive simulations on synthetic data, show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the best available methods in the literature, particularly when the input data are noisy or incomplete. The software implementing our algorithm is available in the public domain as a web tool under the name MSTmap.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of merging genetic maps, when the individual genetic maps are given as directed acyclic graphs. The computational problem is to build a consensus map, which is a directed graph that includes and is consistent with all (or, the vast majority of) the markers in the input maps. However, when markers in the individual maps have ordering conflicts, the resulting consensus map will contain cycles. Here, we formulate the problem of resolving cycles in the context of a parsimonious paradigm that takes into account two types of errors that may be present in the input maps, namely, local reshuffles and global displacements. The resulting combinatorial optimization problem is, in turn, expressed as an integer linear program. A fast approximation algorithm is proposed, and an additional speedup heuristic is developed. Our algorithms were implemented in a software tool named MERGEMAP which is freely available for academic use. An extensive set of experiments shows that MERGEMAP consistently outperforms JOINMAP, which is the most popular tool currently available for this task, both in terms of accuracy and running time. MERGEMAP is available for download at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~yonghui/mgmap.html.},

  Abstract                 = {In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and other fishes, embryonic development rate is an ecologically and evolutionarily important trait that is closely associated with survival and physiological performance later in life. To identify genes differentially regulated in fast and slow-developing embryos of rainbow trout, we examined gene expression across developmental time points in rainbow trout embryos possessing alleles linked to a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fast versus slow embryonic development rate. Whole genome expression microarray analyses were conducted using embryos from a fourth generation backcross family, whereby each backcross generation involved the introgression of the fast-developing alleles for a major development rate QTL into a slow-developing clonal line of rainbow trout. Embryos were collected at 15, 19, and 28 days post-fertilization; sex and QTL genotype were determined using molecular markers, and cDNA from 48 embryos were used for microarray analysis. A total of 183 features were identified with significant differences between embryonic development rate genotypes. Genes associated with cell cycle growth, muscle contraction and protein synthesis were expressed significantly higher in embryos with the fast-developing allele (Clearwater) than those with the slow-developing allele (Oregon State University), which may associate with fast growth and early body mass construction in embryo development. Across time points, individuals with the fast-developing QTL allele appeared to have earlier onset of these developmental processes when compared to individuals with the slow development alleles, even as early as 15 days post-fertilization. Differentially expressed candidate genes chosen for linkage mapping were localized primarily to regions outside of the major embryonic development rate QTL, with the exception of a single gene (very low-density lipoprotein receptor precursor).},

  Abstract                 = {Chromosomal regions associated with marker segregation distortion in rice were compared based on six molecular linkage maps. Mapping populations were derived from one interspecific backcross and five inter-subspecific (indica/japonica) crosses, including two F2 populations, two doubled haploid (DH) populations, and one recombinant inbred (RI) population. Mapping data for each population consisted of 129-629 markers. Segregation distortion was determined based on chi-square analysis (P < 0.01) and was observed at 6.8-31.8%, of the mapped marker loci. Marker loci associated with skewed allele frequencies were distributed on all 12 chromosomes. Distortion in eight chromosomal regions bracketed previously identified gametophyte (ga) or sterility genes (S). Distortion in three other chromosomal regions was found only in DH populations, where japonica alleles were over-represented, suggesting that loci in these regions may be associated with preferential regeneration of japonica genotypes during anther culture. Three additional clusters of skewed markers were observed in more than one population in regions where no gametophytic or sterility loci have previously been reported. A total of 17 segregation distortion loci may be postulated based on this study and their locations in the rice genome were estimated.},

  Abstract                 = {KEY MESSAGE: Here, we report on copy number variation of transposable elements and on the genome-specific proliferation in wheat. In addition, we report on revolutionary and evolutionary dynamics of transposons. Wheat is a valuable model for understanding the involvement of transposable elements (TEs) in speciation as wheat species (Triticum-Aegilops group) have diverged from a common ancestor, have undergone two events of speciation through allopolyploidy, and contain a very high fraction of TEs. However, an unbiased genome-wide examination of TE variation among these species has not been conducted. Our research utilized quantitative real time PCR to assess the relative copy numbers of 16 TE families in various Triticum and Aegilops species. We found (1) high variation and genome-specificity of TEs in wheat species, suggesting they were active throughout the evolution of wheat, (2) neither Ae. searsii nor Ae. speltoides by themselves can be the only contributors of the B genome to wheat, and (3) nonadditive changes in TE quantities in polyploid wheat. This study indicates the apparent involvement of large TEs in creating genetic variation in revolutionary and evolutionary scales following allopolyploidization events, presumably assisting in the diploidization of homeologous chromosomes.},

The segregation analysis was performed using 76 doubled haploid rainbow trout produced by androgenesis from a hybrid between the "OSU" and "Arlee" androgenetically derived homozygous lines. Four hundred and seventy-six markers segregated into 31 major linkage groups and 11 small groups (<5 markers/group). The minimum genome size is estimated to be 2627.5 cM in length. The sex-determining locus segregated to a distal position on one of the linkage groups. We analyzed the chromosomal distribution of three classes of markers: (1) amplified fragment length polymorphisms, (2) variable number of tandem repeats, and (3) markers obtained using probes homologous to the 5' or 3' end of salmonid-specific small interspersed nuclear elements. Many of the first class of markers were clustered in regions that appear to correspond to centromeres. The second class of markers were more telomeric in distribution, and the third class were intermediate. Tetrasomic inheritance, apparently related to the tetraploid ancestry of salmonid fishes, was detected at one simple sequence repeat locus and suggested by the presence of one extremely large linkage group that appeared to consist of two smaller groups linked at their tips. The double haploid rainbow trout lines and linkage map present a foundation for further genomic studies.},

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present study, a haploid population from the cross of the two cultivated allotetraploid cottons, Gossypium hirsutum L. and Gossypium barbadense L., was developed by means of Vsg, a virescently marked semigamous line of Sea island cotton, and some target haploids were successfully doubled with colchicine. A molecular linkage map was constructed with 58 doubled and haploid plants. Among the total of 624 marker loci (510 SSRs and 114 RAPDs), 489 loci were assembled into 43 linkage groups and covered 3,314.5 centi-Morgans (cM). Using the monosomic and telodisomic genetic stocks, the linkage groups of the present map were associated with chromosomes of the allotetraploid genome, and some of the unassociated groups were connected to corresponding A or D subgenomes. Through the analysis of the assignment of the duplicated SSR loci in the chromosomes or the linkage groups, ten pairs of possible homoeologous chromosome (or linkage group) regions were identified. Among them, the pairs of Chrs. 1 and 15, Chrs. 4 and 22, and Chrs. 10 and 20 had already been determined as homoeologous by classical genetic and cytogenetic research, and the pair of Chrs. 9 and 23 had also been identified by the ISH method of molecular cytogenetics. But, from present research, it was assumed that Chrs. 5 and 18 might be a new pair of homoeologous chromosomes of the allotetraploid cotton genome detected by molecular mapping of the cotton genome.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed the completed human genome for recent segmental duplications (size > or = 1 kb and sequence similarity > or = 90%). We found that approximately 4% of the genome is covered by duplications and that the extent of segmental duplication varies from 1% to 14% among the 24 chromosomes. Intrachromosomal duplication is more frequent than interchromosomal duplication in 15 chromosomes. The duplication frequencies in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are greater than the genome average by approximately threefold and fourfold. We examined factors that may affect the frequency of duplication in a region. Within individual chromosomes, the duplication frequency shows little correlation with local gene density, repeat density, recombination rate, and GC content, except chromosomes 7 and Y. For the entire genome, the duplication frequency is correlated with each of the above factors. Based on known genes and Ensembl genes, the proportion of duplications containing complete genes is 3.4% and 10.7%, respectively. The proportion of duplications containing genes is higher in intrachromosomal than in interchromosomal duplications, and duplications containing genes have a higher sequence similarity and tend to be longer than duplications containing no genes. Our simulation suggests that many duplications containing genes have been selectively maintained in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Cotton is the world's most important natural textile fiber and a significant oilseed crop. Decoding cotton genomes will provide the ultimate reference and resource for research and utilization of the species. Integration of high-density genetic maps with genomic sequence information will largely accelerate the process of whole-genome assembly in cotton. RESULTS: In this paper, we update a high-density interspecific genetic linkage map of allotetraploid cultivated cotton. An additional 1,167 marker loci have been added to our previously published map of 2,247 loci. Three new marker types, InDel (insertion-deletion) and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) developed from gene information, and REMAP (retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism), were used to increase map density. The updated map consists of 3,414 loci in 26 linkage groups covering 3,667.62 cM with an average inter-locus distance of 1.08 cM. Furthermore, genome-wide sequence analysis was finished using 3,324 informative sequence-based markers and publicly-available Gossypium DNA sequence information. A total of 413,113 EST and 195 BAC sequences were physically anchored and clustered by 3,324 sequence-based markers. Of these, 14,243 ESTs and 188 BACs from different species of Gossypium were clustered and specifically anchored to the high-density genetic map. A total of 2,748 candidate unigenes from 2,111 ESTs clusters and 63 BACs were mined for functional annotation and classification. The 337 ESTs/genes related to fiber quality traits were integrated with 132 previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative trait loci, which demonstrated the important roles in fiber quality of these genes. Higher-level sequence conservation between different cotton species and between the A- and D-subgenomes in tetraploid cotton was found, indicating a common evolutionary origin for orthologous and paralogous loci in Gossypium. CONCLUSION: This study will serve as a valuable genomic resource for tetraploid cotton genome assembly, for cloning genes related to superior agronomic traits, and for further comparative genomic analyses in Gossypium.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Copy number abbreviation (CNA) is one type of genomic aberration that is often induced by genome instability and is associated with diseases such as cancer. Determination of the genome-wide CNA profile is an important step in identifying the underlying mutation mechanisms. Genomic data based on next-generation sequencing technology are particularly suitable for determination of high-quality CNA profile. Now is an important time to reevaluate the use of sequencing techniques for CNA analysis, especially with the rapid growth of the different targeted genome and whole-genome sequencing strategies. RESULTS: In this study, we provide a comparison of resequencing strategies, with regard to their utility, applied to the same hepatocellular carcinoma sample for copy number determination. These strategies include whole-genome, exome and restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. The last of these strategies is a targeted sequencing technique that involves cutting the genome with a restriction enzyme and isolating the targeted sequences. Our data demonstrate that RAD sequencing is an efficient and comprehensive strategy that allows the cost-effective determination of CNAs. Further investigation of RAD sequencing data led to the finding that a precise measurement of the allele frequency would be a helpful complement to the read depth for CNA analysis for two reasons. First, knowledge of the allele frequency helps to resolve refined calculations of allele-specific copy numbers, which, in turn, identify the functionally important CNAs that are under natural selection on the parental alleles. Second, this knowledge enables deconvolution of CNA patterns in complex genomic regions.},
